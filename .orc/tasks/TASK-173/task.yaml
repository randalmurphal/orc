title: 'Phase 2: React - Task List page'
description: |-
    ## Purpose
    Port the Task List page with filtering and search.

    ## Components to Port

    ### TaskList page
    - Filter bar (initiative, dependency status dropdowns)
    - Search input with debounce
    - Task cards in list layout
    - Keyboard navigation (j/k)

    ### Filter Components
    - InitiativeDropdown.svelte -> InitiativeDropdown.tsx
    - DependencyDropdown.svelte -> DependencyDropdown.tsx

    ### Task Card (list variant)
    - Compact card for list view
    - Same info as board card but different layout

    ## Filtering Logic
    - Filter by initiative (including 'Unassigned')
    - Filter by dependency status (all/blocked/ready/none)
    - Search by title/ID
    - Filters combine (AND logic)
    - Persist to URL params

    ## Success Criteria
    - All filters work correctly
    - Search debounces properly
    - Keyboard nav works (j/k/Enter)
    - URL params sync with filters
