title: Implement bidirectional sync between files and UI - drag-drop updates files, file artifacts inform column position
description: |
    See spec.md for full architectural design. Key phases:
    1. Read-side: Derive column from artifacts (spec.md exists = Spec column)
    2. Write-side: PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/move endpoint, drag-drop updates files
    3. Undo/Redo: Client-side stack with server validation
    4. Executor: Detect existing artifacts, prompt to skip phases
