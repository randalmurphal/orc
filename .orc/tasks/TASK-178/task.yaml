title: 'Phase 3: Integration - Connect all stores and real-time updates'
description: |-
    ## Purpose
    Integrate all components with stores and verify real-time updates work across the app.

    ## Integration Tasks

    ### WebSocket Event Flow
    - Verify task_created events appear on Board and Task List
    - Verify task_updated events update cards in place
    - Verify task_deleted events remove cards with toast
    - Verify state/phase events update running tasks
    - Verify finalize events update FinalizeModal

    ### Store Synchronization
    - Project change clears/reloads tasks and initiatives
    - Initiative filter reflects in Board and Task List
    - Dependency filter works on both pages
    - URL params sync bidirectionally with stores

    ### Cross-Component State
    - Running task count in Dashboard matches Board
    - Initiative progress updates when tasks complete
    - Sidebar initiative counts stay in sync

    ### Browser Integration
    - Back/forward navigation restores correct state
    - Page refresh preserves all filters
    - Deep links work correctly

    ## Testing Approach
    - Run React app alongside Svelte app
    - Perform same actions on both
    - Compare behavior

    ## Success Criteria
    - All real-time updates work
    - State is consistent across components
    - Browser history works correctly
