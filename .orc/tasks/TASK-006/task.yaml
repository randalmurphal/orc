title: Fix running task column placement and add better visual indicator
description: 'Running tasks currently show in ''Queued'' column instead of a running state. Need: 1) Running tasks should show in appropriate column based on current_phase (e.g., if running implement phase, show in Implement column), 2) Add visual indicator for running tasks - subtle animation or pulsing border to distinguish from pending tasks, 3) Ensure state.yaml current_phase is reflected in the board view.'
