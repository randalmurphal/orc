title: 'Phase 0: Expand E2E tests for Filters and URL persistence (14 tests)'
description: |-
    ## Purpose
    E2E tests for filter functionality and URL/localStorage state persistence.

    ## Test Coverage (14 tests)

    ### Initiative Filter (7 tests)
    - should show initiative dropdown in task list header
    - should show initiative dropdown in board header
    - should filter tasks when initiative selected
    - should show Unassigned filter option
    - should persist initiative filter in URL (?initiative=xxx)
    - should persist initiative filter in localStorage
    - should sync filter between sidebar and dropdown

    ### Dependency Filter (4 tests)
    - should show dependency status dropdown
    - should filter to blocked tasks only
    - should filter to ready tasks only
    - should combine with initiative filter correctly

    ### Search (3 tests)
    - should filter tasks by title/ID as user types
    - should clear search when X button clicked
    - should debounce search input (not fire on every keystroke)

    ## State Persistence Pattern
    - URL param takes precedence over localStorage
    - Browser back/forward should navigate filter history
    - Page refresh should restore filter state

    ## Success Criteria
    - All 14 tests pass
    - URL state persists correctly across page refresh
