title: Add live transcript viewer for running tasks in UI
description: 'When clicking on a running task in the board or task list, show a live view of Claude''s transcript output. Options: 1) Use orc''s captured transcripts from .orc/tasks/TASK-XXX/transcripts/, 2) Read directly from Claude Code''s transcript storage (~/.claude-code/transcripts/), 3) Stream via WebSocket for live updates. Should show the raw Claude interaction including tool calls and responses. Essential for monitoring task execution progress.'
