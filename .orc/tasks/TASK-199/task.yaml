title: 'Bug: Blocker check doesn''t recognize ''finished'' status as complete'
description: When checking if a task's blockers are resolved, only 'completed' status is recognized. Tasks with 'finished' status (merged to main) still block dependent tasks. The IsComplete() or equivalent check should include both 'completed' and 'finished' statuses.
