title: Sync task branch with target before completion
description: 'During task execution, the task branch should periodically or at completion sync with the target branch (main) to detect and resolve conflicts early. Currently, parallel tasks can diverge significantly, causing merge conflicts at completion. Options: 1) Sync at start of each phase, 2) Sync only at completion, 3) Detect conflicts before PR creation. This would catch issues like the TASK-014/015/016 merge conflicts before they pile up.'
