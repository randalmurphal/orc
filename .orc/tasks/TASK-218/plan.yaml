description: Medium task - spec, implement, test, docs with clear success criteria
phases:
    - id: spec
      name: spec
      prompt: |
        Create a specification for this task:

        **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
        **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
        **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

        {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

        ## Instructions

        Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
        and how to verify it's complete.

        ### 1. Problem Statement
        Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

        ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
        Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
        - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
        - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
        - Include both functional and quality criteria

        ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
        Specify what tests must pass:
        - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
        - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
        - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

        ### 4. Scope
        Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
        - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
        - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

        ### 5. Technical Approach
        Brief plan for implementation:
        - Files to modify
        - Key changes in each file

        ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

        **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
        - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
        - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
        - Expected Behavior: What should happen
        - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
        - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

        **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
        - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
        - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

        **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
        - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
        - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
        - Risk Assessment: What could break

        ## Output Format

        Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

        <artifact>
        # Specification: {{TASK_TITLE}}

        ## Problem Statement
        [1-2 sentences]

        ## Success Criteria
        - [ ] [Criterion 1]
        - [ ] [Criterion 2]

        ## Testing Requirements
        - [ ] [Test 1]
        - [ ] [Test 2]

        ## Scope
        ### In Scope
        - [Item]
        ### Out of Scope
        - [Item]

        ## Technical Approach
        [Brief implementation plan]

        ### Files to Modify
        - [file]: [change]

        ## [Category-Specific Section]
        [Include appropriate section based on category]
        </artifact>

        After completing the spec, commit:
        ```bash
        git add -A
        git commit -m "[orc] {{TASK_ID}}: spec - completed"
        ```

        Then output:
        ```
        **Commit**: [SHA]
        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
        ```

        If blocked (requirements unclear):
        ```
        <phase_blocked>
        reason: [what's unclear]
        needs: [what clarification is needed]
        </phase_blocked>
        ```
      gate:
        type: auto
      checkpoint: true
      status: pending
    - id: implement
      name: implement
      prompt: |
        Implement the task according to the specification:

        **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
        **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}

        {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

        ## Specification

        {{SPEC_CONTENT}}

        {{RETRY_CONTEXT}}

        ## Instructions

        1. Review the spec's success criteria - these are your acceptance criteria
        2. Implement the required changes following the technical approach
        3. Write/update tests alongside code (as specified in Testing Requirements)
        4. Run tests and fix any failures
        5. Self-review against success criteria before completing

        ### Self-Review Checklist
        - [ ] All success criteria from spec addressed
        - [ ] All testing requirements satisfied
        - [ ] Scope boundaries respected (no extra features)
        - [ ] Error handling complete
        - [ ] Code follows project patterns

        Keep iterating until implementation is complete and tests pass.

        After completing, commit:
        ```bash
        git add -A
