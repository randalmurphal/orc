title: Investigate incorrect token count in phase execution
description: 'The implement phase for TASK-002 shows only 56 input tokens which seems impossibly low - the prompt alone should be more than that. Either the token counting is broken, or there''s a bug in how Claude reports tokens in headless mode (--print --output-format json). Check: 1) How tokens are extracted from Claude response, 2) Whether the JSON output includes token counts, 3) If this is a Claude CLI bug vs orc parsing bug.'
