title: 'Fix: Re-running completed tasks fails to push due to diverged remote branch'
description: 'When a task is re-run after being previously completed and pushed, the completion action fails with ''non-fast-forward'' error because the remote branch has different history from the new run. Current workaround requires manual force push. Options: 1) Detect diverged remote and force push automatically, 2) Delete remote branch before re-run, 3) Rebase onto remote before push. Should also consider if this is the right behavior - maybe re-runs should continue from remote state instead of starting fresh.'
