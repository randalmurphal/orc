title: 'Phase 2: React - Board page (flat and swimlane views)'
description: |-
    ## Purpose
    Port the Kanban board with both flat and swimlane view modes.

    ## Components to Port

    ### Board.svelte -> Board.tsx
    - View mode toggle (flat/swimlane)
    - Filter dropdowns (initiative, dependency status)
    - Column rendering

    ### Column.svelte -> Column.tsx
    - Column header with count
    - Task card container
    - Drop zone for drag-drop

    ### QueuedColumn.svelte -> QueuedColumn.tsx
    - Special column with active/backlog sections
    - Collapsible backlog

    ### Swimlane.svelte -> Swimlane.tsx
    - Initiative row with all columns
    - Collapsible with progress indicator
    - 'Unassigned' swimlane for orphan tasks

    ### TaskCard.svelte (kanban) -> TaskCard.tsx
    - Task ID, title, description preview
    - Weight, priority, phase badges
    - Action buttons (run, pause, finalize, menu)
    - Running state with pulsing animation
    - Finalizing state with progress bar
    - Finished state with merge badge

    ## Drag-Drop Implementation
    - Use @dnd-kit/core or react-beautiful-dnd
    - Drag between columns = status change
    - Drag between swimlanes = initiative change (with confirm)

    ## Success Criteria
    - Both view modes work identically
    - Drag-drop changes status/initiative
    - Running tasks show animation
    - E2E tests from Phase 0 pass
