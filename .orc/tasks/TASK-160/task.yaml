title: 'Phase 0: Expand E2E tests for Keyboard shortcuts (12 tests)'
description: |-
    ## Purpose
    E2E tests for the keyboard shortcut system - uses Shift+Alt modifier to avoid browser conflicts.

    ## Test Coverage (12 tests)

    ### Global Shortcuts (6 tests)
    - should open command palette with Shift+Alt+K
    - should open new task modal with Shift+Alt+N
    - should toggle sidebar with Shift+Alt+B
    - should open project switcher with Shift+Alt+P
    - should show keyboard help with ? key
    - should close all modals with Escape

    ### Navigation Sequences (3 tests)
    - should navigate to dashboard with g then d
    - should navigate to tasks with g then t
    - should navigate to environment with g then e

    ### Task List Context (3 tests)
    - should navigate tasks with j/k keys
    - should open selected task with Enter
    - should focus search with / key

    ## Implementation Notes
    - Keyboard shortcuts use Shift+Alt (not Cmd/Ctrl) to avoid browser conflicts
    - Multi-key sequences have timing window
    - Context-aware: some shortcuts only work in certain pages

    ## Success Criteria
    - All 12 tests pass
    - Tests verify actual navigation/modal behavior
