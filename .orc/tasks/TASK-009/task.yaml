title: Persist selected project in URL/localStorage to survive page refresh
description: 'When viewing a project other than the server''s default, refreshing the page should keep you on that project - not revert to the server''s startup directory. Options: 1) Store projectId in URL params (?project=xxx), 2) Store in localStorage, 3) Both (URL takes precedence). Should also update browser history so back button works.'
