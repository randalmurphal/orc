title: Fix pre-existing test failures to prevent noise in task execution
description: 'Several tests fail in main branch: TestGetClaudeMDEndpoint_NotFound, TestGeneratePrompt in internal/setup. These create noise during task execution when Claude runs test suite. Need to fix these or mark as skipped with clear reason. Current state: Claude has to work around/ignore these failures.'
