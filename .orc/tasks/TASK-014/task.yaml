title: Fix go.work compatibility in worktrees
description: 'When running tests in a worktree, go.work causes ''pattern ./... does not contain modules listed in go.work'' error. Need to either: 1) Copy/symlink go.work to worktree, 2) Create worktree-specific go.work, 3) Run tests without go.work in worktrees. This blocks Claude from running full test suite during execution.'
