title: Task board should live refresh when tasks added via CLI or filesystem
description: Currently the kanban board doesn't update in real-time when tasks are created via CLI or direct filesystem edits. The file watcher infrastructure exists (WebSocket events for task_created/task_updated/task_deleted) but the board may not be subscribed to these events properly. Verify the event flow from file watcher -> WebSocket -> board component and fix any gaps.
