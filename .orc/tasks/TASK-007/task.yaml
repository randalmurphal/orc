title: Add backlog and active queue organization with priority levels
description: 'Explore task organization patterns: 1) Backlog vs Active queue separation - tasks in backlog are ''someday'' items, active queue is current work, 2) Possible folder/grouping system for backlog organization, 3) Maybe priority levels or swimlanes, 4) Consider how initiatives already group tasks and if that''s sufficient. Research Linear, Jira, GitHub Projects for patterns. Goal: prevent cognitive overload when many tasks accumulate.'
