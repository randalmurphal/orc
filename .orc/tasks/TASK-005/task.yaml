title: Fix server to work regardless of startup directory
description: 'The API server currently uses its cwd as the default project. This breaks when started from a different directory. Options: 1) Require explicit project selection in UI, 2) Use ''default project'' from global config, 3) Show project picker on first load. The /api/projects/{id}/tasks endpoint already works correctly - this is about the UX of /api/tasks and the web UI default behavior.'
