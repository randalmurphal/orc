title: Integrate Playwright MCP tools in task execution for UI testing
description: 'When a task has requires_ui_testing: true, ensure Claude session has Playwright MCP tools available. During test phase: 1) Claude should run Playwright tests, 2) Capture screenshots for visual verification, 3) Auto-attach screenshots to task. Configure MCP server in Claude settings if not present. Add prompts that guide Claude to use visual testing for UI changes. Depends on TASK-020 (attachments) and TASK-021 (detection).'
