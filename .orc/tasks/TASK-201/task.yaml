title: 'Bug: Sync fails with ''0 files in conflict'' error'
description: 'TASK-180 failed during sync_on_start with error: ''sync conflict detected: task branch has 0 files in conflict with target''. If there are 0 conflicts, sync should succeed, not fail. The error message shows ''Conflicting files: []'' - an empty list. Bug is in the sync logic that triggers conflict detection even when no actual conflicts exist.'
