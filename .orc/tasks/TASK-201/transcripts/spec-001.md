# spec - Iteration 1

## Prompt

Create a specification for this task:

**Task**: Bug: Sync fails with '0 files in conflict' error
**Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
**Description**: TASK-180 failed during sync_on_start with error: 'sync conflict detected: task branch has 0 files in conflict with target'. If there are 0 conflicts, sync should succeed, not fail. The error message shows 'Conflicting files: []' - an empty list. Bug is in the sync logic that triggers conflict detection even when no actual conflicts exist.

{{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

## Instructions

Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
and how to verify it's complete.

### 1. Problem Statement
Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
- Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
- No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
- Include both functional and quality criteria

### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
Specify what tests must pass:
- [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
- [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
- [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

### 4. Scope
Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
- **In Scope**: What will be implemented
- **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

### 5. Technical Approach
Brief plan for implementation:
- Files to modify
- Key changes in each file

### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

**If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
- Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
- Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
- Expected Behavior: What should happen
- Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
- Verification: How to confirm the fix works

**If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
- User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
- Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

**If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
- Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
- After Pattern: Target code/architecture
- Risk Assessment: What could break

## Output Format

After completing the spec, commit:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[orc] TASK-201: spec - completed"
```

Then output:
```
**Commit**: [SHA]
<phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
```

If blocked (requirements unclear):
```
<phase_blocked>
reason: [what's unclear]
needs: [what clarification is needed]
</phase_blocked>
```


## Response

**Commit**: 6f180677
