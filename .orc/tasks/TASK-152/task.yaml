title: 'Bug: Worktrees disappear during parallel task execution'
description: When running multiple tasks in parallel, worktrees get cleaned up while tasks are still using them, causing 'chdir no such file or directory' errors. Likely a race condition in worktree cleanup logic - one task's cleanup is removing another task's worktree, or worktree names are colliding.
