          prompt: |
            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

            <artifact>
            # Specification: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            ## Problem Statement
            [1-2 sentences]

            ## Success Criteria
            - [ ] [Criterion 1]
            - [ ] [Criterion 2]

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
            [Brief implementation plan]

            ### Files to Modify
            - [file]: [change]

            ## [Category-Specific Section]
            [Include appropriate section based on category]
            </artifact>

            After completing the spec, commit:
            ```bash
            git add -A
            git commit -m "[orc] {{TASK_ID}}: spec - completed"
            ```

            Then output:

            **Commit**: [SHA]
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
            ```

            If blocked (requirements unclear):
            ```
            <phase_blocked>
            reason: [what's unclear]
            needs: [what clarification is needed]
            </phase_blocked>

            Implement the task according to the specification:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Specification

            {{SPEC_CONTENT}}

            {{RETRY_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            1. Review the spec's success criteria - these are your acceptance criteria
            2. Implement the required changes following the technical approach
            3. Write/update tests alongside code (as specified in Testing Requirements)
            4. Run tests and fix any failures
            5. Self-review against success criteria before completing

            ### Self-Review Checklist
            - [ ] All success criteria from spec addressed
            - [ ] All testing requirements satisfied
            - [ ] Scope boundaries respected (no extra features)
            - [ ] Error handling complete
            - [ ] Code follows project patterns

            Keep iterating until implementation is complete and tests pass.

spec: |-
    The commit message says "spec - completed" but there are no files in the commit. This confirms specs are stored in the database (`.orc/tasks/`) and not committed to git.

    Let me re-read the original instruction more carefully - the instruction says to commit after completing the spec, but since `.orc/tasks/` is gitignored, there won't be any git changes to commit. The spec is simply stored in the file I created.

    The phase completion is signaled by outputting `<phase_complete>true</phase_complete>`, and the spec I created is already saved to the right location (`.orc/tasks/TASK-241/spec.md`).

    **Commit**: (no files to commit - spec stored in database)

    <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

Scope\nDefine boundaries to prevent scope creep:\n- **In Scope**: What will be implemented\n- **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented\n\n### 5.

        ## Response

        ## Summary

        The implementation of `--limit/-n` flag for `orc list` has been verified:

        ### Testing Requirements - All Satisfied ✅
        1. `TestListCommand_Flags` - verifies `--limit` flag exists with shorthand `-n`
        2. `TestListCommand_LimitFlag` - verifies limit restricts output to N tasks
        3. `TestListCommand_LimitZero` - verifies `--limit 0` shows all tasks
        4. `TestListCommand_LimitWithFilters` - verifies limit applies after filtering
        5. `TestListCommand_LimitExceedsTotal` - verifies limit > total shows all tasks

        ### Success Criteria - All Met ✅
        - `--limit`/`-n` flag added accepting positive integer
        - Shows last N tasks (most recent by creation time)
        - `--limit 0` or omitting flag shows all tasks
        - Works with `--initiative`, `--status`, `--weight` filters
        - Help text updated with examples
        - CLI documentation (`COMMANDS.md`) updated

        ### Code Quality ✅
        - No linting issues
        - All edge cases handled (negative values, zero, exceeds total)
        - Tests pass with coverage

        **Commit**: 7f686544 (implementation commit - no new changes needed for test phase)
