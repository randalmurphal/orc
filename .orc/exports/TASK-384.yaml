    title: Implement decision_required WebSocket event
    description: |-
        Add decision_required WebSocket event for when an agent needs user input, enabling real-time display in the DecisionsPanel.

        **Event Schema:**
        ```json
        {
          "type": "decision_required",
          "data": {
            "decision_id": "dec_abc123",
            "task_id": "TASK-345",
            "task_title": "Implement Pipeline component",
            "phase": "implement",
            "question": "Should the pipeline show elapsed time for each phase?",
            "options": [
              {"id": "yes", "label": "Yes, show per-phase timing"},
              {"id": "no", "label": "No, only total elapsed"},
              {"id": "config", "label": "Make it configurable"}
            ],
            "context": "The mockup shows total time only, but detailed timing could be useful for debugging.",
            "requested_at": "2026-01-16T14:30:00Z",
            "timeout_seconds": 300
          }
        }
        ```

        **Response endpoint needed:**
        POST /api/decisions/:id with body: {"option_id": "yes"}

        **Implementation:**
        1. Add decision_required event type to internal/api/websocket.go
        2. Create Decision struct in internal/task/decision.go
        3. Add pending decisions storage (in-memory or DB)
        4. Hook into executor when agent requests input
        5. Create POST /api/decisions/:id endpoint for responses
        6. Broadcast decision_resolved event when answered
        7. Handle timeout (auto-select default or fail task)

        **Files to create/modify:**
        - internal/task/decision.go (create Decision model)
        - internal/api/websocket.go (add event types)
        - internal/api/decisions.go (create POST handler)
        - internal/api/routes.go (add decision routes)
        - internal/executor/executor.go (emit decision events)

        **Success criteria:**
        - Event broadcasts immediately when agent requests decision
        - DecisionsPanel updates in real-time
        - Submitting answer resolves the decision
        - Timeout triggers after specified seconds
        - Multiple pending decisions can exist simultaneously
        - Decision history is preserved for audit

            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            - [ ] [Criterion 2]

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
