            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

            <artifact>
            # Specification: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            ## Problem Statement
            [1-2 sentences]

            ## Success Criteria
            - [ ] [Criterion 1]
            - [ ] [Criterion 2]

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
            [Brief implementation plan]

            ### Files to Modify
            - [file]: [change]

            ## [Category-Specific Section]
            [Include appropriate section based on category]
            </artifact>

            After completing the spec, commit:
            ```bash
            git add -A
            git commit -m "[orc] {{TASK_ID}}: spec - completed"
            ```

            Then output:
            ```
            **Commit**: [SHA]
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
            ```

            If blocked (requirements unclear):
            ```
            <phase_blocked>
            reason: [what's unclear]
            needs: [what clarification is needed]
            </phase_blocked>
            ```

            Implement the task according to the specification:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Specification

            {{SPEC_CONTENT}}

            {{RETRY_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            1. Review the spec's success criteria - these are your acceptance criteria
            2. Implement the required changes following the technical approach
            3. Write/update tests alongside code (as specified in Testing Requirements)
            4. Run tests and fix any failures
            5. Self-review against success criteria before completing

            ### Self-Review Checklist
            - [ ] All success criteria from spec addressed
            - [ ] All testing requirements satisfied
            - [ ] Scope boundaries respected (no extra features)
            - [ ] Error handling complete
            - [ ] Code follows project patterns

            Keep iterating until implementation is complete and tests pass.

            After completing, commit:
            ```bash
            git add -A
            git commit -m "[orc] {{TASK_ID}}: implement - completed"

            ## Specification

            {{SPEC_CONTENT}}

            ## Instructions

            1. Run the full test suite
            2. Verify all Testing Requirements from spec are satisfied
            3. Review code for quality issues
            4. Check for edge cases and security issues
            5. Fix any problems found

            ### Verification Against Spec
            Go through each Success Criterion and Testing Requirement from the spec
            and verify it's satisfied.

            Keep iterating until all tests pass and code quality is acceptable.
