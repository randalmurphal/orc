    title: Implement session_update WebSocket event
    description: |-
        Add session_update WebSocket event that broadcasts when session metrics change, enabling real-time updates in the TopBar.

        **Event Schema:**
        ```json
        {
          "type": "session_update",
          "data": {
            "duration_seconds": 3650,
            "total_tokens": 127500,
            "estimated_cost_usd": 2.51,
            "tasks_running": 2,
            "is_paused": false
          }
        }
        ```

        **Trigger conditions:**
        - Every 10 seconds while tasks are running (heartbeat)
        - Immediately when a task completes (tokens/cost change)
        - Immediately when pause/resume is triggered
        - Immediately when a new task starts

        **Implementation:**
        1. Add session_update event type to internal/api/websocket.go
        2. Create sessionBroadcaster that tracks session state
        3. Hook into executor events for task start/complete/pause
        4. Set up 10-second ticker for duration updates during active work
        5. Broadcast to all connected WebSocket clients

        **Files to modify:**
        - internal/api/websocket.go (add event type and broadcaster)
        - internal/api/hub.go (if separate hub file exists)
        - internal/executor/executor.go (emit events on state changes)

        **Success criteria:**
        - Event broadcasts within 100ms of state change
        - Duration updates at least every 10s during active work
        - No broadcasts when idle (no tasks running)
        - Multiple browser tabs receive updates simultaneously
        - Reconnecting clients receive current state immediately

            Implement the following task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{RETRY_CONTEXT}}

            1. Implement the required changes
            2. Write/update tests as needed
            3. Run tests and fix any failures

            Keep iterating until implementation is complete and all tests pass.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

            Final test verification for: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Original task**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            1. Run the full test suite
            2. Fix any failures found
            3. Verify edge cases are covered

            Keep iterating until all tests pass.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
