    title: Truncate task card descriptions on board to max 2-3 lines
    description: |-
        ## Problem
        Task cards on the Board page show full descriptions which can be very long:
        - TASK-220 description takes up the entire card height
        - TASK-218 description is even longer with full markdown content
        - Makes the board unusable when cards are larger than the viewport

        ## Expected Behavior
        1. Limit description to 2-3 lines with ellipsis (...)
        2. Optionally show full description on hover or in a tooltip
        3. Maintain consistent card heights for better board layout

        ## Location
        - components/board/TaskCard.tsx
        - Description paragraph element

        ## Technical Notes
        - Use CSS line-clamp for truncation
        - Consider max-height with overflow hidden
        - Match styling with task list page which may have similar issue

    phases:
        - id: spec
          name: spec
          prompt: |
            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

            <artifact>
            # Specification: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            ## Problem Statement
            [1-2 sentences]

            ## Success Criteria
            - [ ] [Criterion 1]
            - [ ] [Criterion 2]

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
            [Brief implementation plan]

            ### Files to Modify
            - [file]: [change]

            ## [Category-Specific Section]
            [Include appropriate section based on category]
            </artifact>

            ```

            If blocked (requirements unclear):
            ```
            <phase_blocked>
            reason: [what's unclear]
            needs: [what clarification is needed]
            </phase_blocked>
            ```

        # spec - Iteration 1

        ## Prompt

        Create a specification for this task:

        **Task**: Truncate task card descriptions on board to max 2-3 lines
        **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
        **Description**: ## Problem
        Task cards on the Board page show full descriptions which can be very long:
        - TASK-220 description takes up the entire card height
        - TASK-218 description is even longer with full markdown content
        - Makes the board unusable when cards are larger than the viewport

        ## Expected Behavior
        1. Limit description to 2-3 lines with ellipsis (...)
        2. Optionally show full description on hover or in a tooltip
        3. Maintain consistent card heights for better board layout

        ## Location
        - components/board/TaskCard.tsx
        - Description paragraph element

        ## Technical Notes
        - Use CSS line-clamp for truncation
        - Consider max-height with overflow hidden
        - Match styling with task list page which may have similar issue

        {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

        ## Instructions

        Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
        and how to verify it's complete.

        ### 1. Problem Statement
        Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

        ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
        Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
        - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
        - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
        - Include both functional and quality criteria

        ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
        Specify what tests must pass:
        - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
        - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
        - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

        ### 4. Scope
        Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
        - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
        - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

        ### 5. Technical Approach
        Brief plan for implementation:
        - Files to modify
        - Key changes in each file

        ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

        **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
        - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
        - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
        - Expected Behavior: What should happen
        - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
        - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

        **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
        - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
        - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

        **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
        - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
        - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
        - Risk Assessment: What could break

        [Include appropriate section based on category]

        ## Instructions

        1. Run the full test suite
        2. Verify all Testing Requirements from spec are satisfied
        3. Review code for quality issues
        4. Check for edge cases and security issues
        5. Fix any problems found

        ### Verification Against Spec
        Go through each Success Criterion and Testing Requirement from the spec
        and verify it's satisfied.

        Keep iterating until all tests pass and code quality is acceptable.

        After completing, commit:
        ```bash
        git add -A
        git commit -m "[orc] TASK-257: test - completed"
        ```

        When done, output:
        ```
        **Commit**: [SHA]
        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
        ```


        ## Response

        **Commit**: a56cf329

        **Summary of implementation verified:**

        1. **CSS Fix** (`TaskCard.css`):
           - Changed `white-space: pre-wrap` to `white-space: normal` to allow line-clamp to work properly
           - Updated `line-clamp` from 2 to 3 lines
           - Added `word-break: break-word` to handle long words

        2. **Tooltip Integration** (`TaskCard.tsx`):
           - Description is now wrapped in `<Tooltip content={task.description}>` showing full text on hover
           - Display shows normalized text while tooltip shows original

        3. **Text Normalization** (`TaskCard.tsx`):
           - Added `normalizeDescription()` function that strips:
             - Heading markers (#, ##, etc.)
             - Bold/italic markers (**, __, *, _)
             - Inline code backticks
             - List markers (-, *, numbered)
             - Multiple newlines (collapsed to spaces)

        4. **Unit Tests** (`TaskCard.test.tsx`):
           - `truncates description to 3 lines via CSS class`
           - `normalizes markdown formatting in description display`
           - `wraps description in tooltip showing full text`

        All 684 unit tests pass. E2E tests have 1 pre-existing failure (unrelated XPath locator issue).

        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
