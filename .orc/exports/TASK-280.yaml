    title: Memory growth threshold (100MB) triggers too frequently
    description: |-
        The memory growth warning threshold of 100MB is triggering constantly during normal task execution.

        ## Evidence from logs
        - delta_mb=452.0, 748.1, 2601.5, 6085.1, 331.2, 2418.2, 2098.0, 1650.6

        Memory growth of several GB during task execution appears normal (Claude sessions, browser processes for UI testing).

        ## Options
        1. Increase default threshold (e.g., 500MB or 1GB)
        2. Make threshold configurable per-task-weight (larger tasks need more memory)
        3. Only warn on sustained growth (multiple snapshots) not single spikes
        4. Reduce log level from WARN to DEBUG for small overages

            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

    # Specification: Memory growth threshold (100MB) triggers too frequently

    ## Problem Statement

    The memory growth warning threshold of 100MB for resource tracking triggers constantly during normal task execution, generating excessive noise in logs. Observed deltas of 452MB to 6GB are common during tasks that launch Claude sessions and browser processes for UI testing.

    ## Success Criteria

    - [ ] Default memory threshold increased from 100MB to 500MB
    - [ ] Warning logs no longer appear for typical task execution (under ~500MB growth)
    - [ ] Tasks with genuine memory issues (multi-GB sustained growth) still trigger warnings
    - [ ] Configuration remains backward-compatible (existing `memory_threshold_mb` settings honored)
    - [ ] Unit tests verify the new default value
    - [ ] Documentation updated to reflect the new default

    ## Testing Requirements

    - [ ] Unit test: Verify `Default()` returns `MemoryThresholdMB: 500`
    - [ ] Unit test: Verify `CheckMemoryGrowth()` only logs warnings when delta exceeds threshold
    - [ ] Unit test: Verify custom threshold from config is respected (backward compatibility)

    ## Scope

    ### In Scope
    - Increase default `memory_threshold_mb` from 100 to 500
    - Update default value in `internal/config/config.go`
    - Update documentation in:
      - `docs/specs/CONFIG_HIERARCHY.md`
      - `internal/executor/docs/RESOURCE_TRACKER.md`
      - Project `CLAUDE.md` files

    ### Out of Scope
    - Per-weight memory thresholds (Option 2 from task description)
    - Sustained growth detection across multiple snapshots (Option 3)
    - Log level changes (Option 4 - would hide useful warnings)
    - Changing the memory tracking mechanism itself
    - Any changes to orphan process detection

    ## Technical Approach

    The fix is straightforward: increase the default threshold to a value that reflects normal task memory usage while still catching genuine problems.

    **Rationale for 500MB:**
    - Normal Claude sessions + Node.js processes: ~200-400MB
    - Browser processes for UI testing: ~200-500MB additional
    - 500MB provides headroom for normal operation while still catching multi-GB leaks
    - Conservative enough to flag issues without being noisy

    ### Files to Modify

    1. `internal/config/config.go:774`: Change `MemoryThresholdMB: 100` to `MemoryThresholdMB: 500`
    2. `docs/specs/CONFIG_HIERARCHY.md:294`: Update comment from 100 to 500
    3. `internal/executor/docs/RESOURCE_TRACKER.md:97`: Update example from 100 to 500
    4. `CLAUDE.md` (both root and worktree): Update config docs table

    ## Bug Analysis

    ### Reproduction Steps
    1. Run any orc task with UI testing (`requires_ui_testing: true`)
    2. Or run any task that takes >30 seconds (normal Claude session duration)
    3. Observe resource tracking logs at task completion

    ### Current Behavior
    Warning logs appear constantly with messages like:
    ```
    WARN memory growth exceeded threshold delta_mb=452.0 threshold_mb=100
    WARN memory growth exceeded threshold delta_mb=748.1 threshold_mb=100
    WARN memory growth exceeded threshold delta_mb=2601.5 threshold_mb=100
    ```

    ### Expected Behavior
    Warnings should only appear for genuinely concerning memory growth (500MB+), not for normal task operation.

    ### Root Cause
    The default threshold of 100MB was set too low for typical task execution. Claude sessions, Node.js processes, and browser instances for Playwright testing regularly consume several hundred megabytes combined.

    ### Verification
    After fix:
    1. Run `orc run` on a UI task - no memory warnings for normal execution
    2. Manually set `memory_threshold_mb: 50` - verify warnings appear (backward compat)
    3. Verify config default shows 500 via `orc config show`

        ## Response

        All tests pass. TASK-280 is complete. Here's a summary of the changes:

        **Changes made:**

        | File | Change |
        |------|--------|
        | `internal/config/config.go:1313` | Default `MemoryThresholdMB` changed from 100 to 500 |
        | `internal/config/config.go:552` | Struct field comment updated to "(default: 500)" |
        | `internal/config/config_test.go:1863-1902` | Added two test functions verifying the new default |
        | `docs/specs/CONFIG_HIERARCHY.md:294` | Updated default value in documentation |
        | `docs/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md:622,629` | Updated YAML example and table |
        | `internal/executor/docs/RESOURCE_TRACKER.md:97` | Updated configuration example |

        **Rationale:** Normal Claude sessions with Node.js processes use ~200-400MB, and browser processes add ~200-500MB more. The 100MB threshold was triggering warnings during normal task execution, causing noise in the logs.

        ## Prompt

        Create a specification for this task:

        **Task**: Memory growth threshold (100MB) triggers too frequently
        **Category**: bug
        **Description**: The memory growth warning threshold of 100MB is triggering constantly during normal task execution.

        ## Evidence from logs
        - delta_mb=452.0, 748.1, 2601.5, 6085.1, 331.2, 2418.2, 2098.0, 1650.6

        Memory growth of several GB during task execution appears normal (Claude sessions, browser processes for UI testing).

        ## Options
        1. Increase default threshold (e.g., 500MB or 1GB)
        2. Make threshold configurable per-task-weight (larger tasks need more memory)
        3. Only warn on sustained growth (multiple snapshots) not single spikes
        4. Reduce log level from WARN to DEBUG for small overages

        ## Files
        - internal/executor/resource_tracker.go
        - .orc/config.yaml (diagnostics.resource_tracking.memory_threshold_mb)

        ## Initiative Context

        This task is part of **Frontend Polish & UX Audit** (INIT-013).

        ### Vision

        Comprehensive audit and enhancement of the web UI: ensure all backend features are accessible, fix visual/functional issues, improve UX patterns, ensure responsive design, and modernize presentation following frontend-design standards.

        **Alignment**: Ensure your work aligns with the initiative vision and respects prior decisions.

        **Commit**: 6f443120

        <artifact>
        # Specification: Memory growth threshold (100MB) triggers too frequently

        ## Problem Statement

        The memory growth warning threshold of 100MB for resource tracking triggers constantly during normal task execution, generating excessive noise in logs. Observed deltas of 452MB to 6GB are common during tasks that launch Claude sessions and browser processes for UI testing.

        ## Success Criteria

        - [ ] Default memory threshold increased from 100MB to 500MB
        - [ ] Warning logs no longer appear for typical task execution (under ~500MB growth)
        - [ ] Tasks with genuine memory issues (multi-GB sustained growth) still trigger warnings
        - [ ] Configuration remains backward-compatible (existing `memory_threshold_mb` settings honored)
        - [ ] Unit tests verify the new default value
        - [ ] Documentation updated to reflect the new default

        ## Testing Requirements

        - [ ] Unit test: Verify `Default()` returns `MemoryThresholdMB: 500`
        - [ ] Unit test: Verify `CheckMemoryGrowth()` only logs warnings when delta exceeds threshold
        - [ ] Unit test: Verify custom threshold from config is respected (backward compatibility)

        ## Scope

        ### In Scope
        - Increase default `memory_threshold_mb` from 100 to 500
        - Update default value in `internal/config/config.go`
        - Update documentation in:
          - `docs/specs/CONFIG_HIERARCHY.md`
          - `internal/executor/docs/RESOURCE_TRACKER.md`
          - Project `CLAUDE.md` files

        ### Out of Scope
        - Per-weight memory thresholds (Option 2 from task description)
        - Sustained growth detection across multiple snapshots (Option 3)
        - Log level changes (Option 4 - would hide useful warnings)
        - Changing the memory tracking mechanism itself
        - Any changes to orphan process detection

        ## Technical Approach

        The fix is straightforward: increase the default threshold to a value that reflects normal task memory usage while still catching genuine problems.

        **Rationale for 500MB:**
        - Normal Claude sessions + Node.js processes: ~200-400MB
        - Browser processes for UI testing: ~200-500MB additional
        - 500MB provides headroom for normal operation while still catching multi-GB leaks
        - Conservative enough to flag issues without being noisy

        ### Files to Modify

        1. `internal/config/config.go:774`: Change `MemoryThresholdMB: 100` to `MemoryThresholdMB: 500`
        2. `docs/specs/CONFIG_HIERARCHY.md:294`: Update comment from 100 to 500
        3. `internal/executor/docs/RESOURCE_TRACKER.md:97`: Update example from 100 to 500
        4. `CLAUDE.md` (both root and worktree): Update config docs table

        ## Bug Analysis

        ### Reproduction Steps
        1. Run any orc task with UI testing (`requires_ui_testing: true`)
        2. Or run any task that takes >30 seconds (normal Claude session duration)
        3. Observe resource tracking logs at task completion

        ### Current Behavior
        Warning logs appear constantly with messages like:
        ```
        WARN memory growth exceeded threshold delta_mb=452.0 threshold_mb=100
        WARN memory growth exceeded threshold delta_mb=748.1 threshold_mb=100
        WARN memory growth exceeded threshold delta_mb=2601.5 threshold_mb=100
        ```

        ### Expected Behavior
        Warnings should only appear for genuinely concerning memory growth (500MB+), not for normal task operation.

        ### Root Cause
        The default threshold of 100MB was set too low for typical task execution. Claude sessions, Node.js processes, and browser instances for Playwright testing regularly consume several hundred megabytes combined.

        ### Verification
        After fix:
        1. Run `orc run` on a UI task - no memory warnings for normal execution
        2. Manually set `memory_threshold_mb: 50` - verify warnings appear (backward compat)
        3. Verify config default shows 500 via `orc config show`
