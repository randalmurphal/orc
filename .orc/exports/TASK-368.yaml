    title: Create CommandList component for slash commands
    description: |-
        Create the CommandList component for displaying and managing slash commands.

        REFERENCE FILES:
        - example_ui/settings.html (.command-list class, lines 214-263)
        - example_ui/Screenshot_20260116_201916.png (command list section)

        SUCCESS CRITERIA:
        1. CommandList component at web/src/components/settings/CommandList.tsx
        2. List of command items, each showing:
           - Icon in 32px colored circle
           - Command name (monospace, e.g., '/review')
           - Description text
           - Edit and Delete icon buttons
        3. Two sections: Project Commands, Global Commands
        4. Section headers with title and description
        5. Global commands use cyan icon color
        6. Visual specs:
           - Item background: var(--bg-surface)
           - Item border: 1px solid var(--border)
           - Item border-radius: 8px
           - Item padding: 12px 14px
           - Hover: border lightens
        7. Click on item selects it for editing
        8. Props:

           - selectedId?: string
           - onSelect: (id) => void

          prompt: |
            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

            <artifact>
            # Specification: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            ## Problem Statement
            [1-2 sentences]

            ## Success Criteria
            - [ ] [Criterion 1]
            - [ ] [Criterion 2]

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
            [Brief implementation plan]

            ### Files to Modify
            - [file]: [change]

            ## [Category-Specific Section]
            [Include appropriate section based on category]
            </artifact>

            After completing the spec, commit:
            ```bash
            git add -A
            git commit -m "[orc] {{TASK_ID}}: spec - completed"
            ```

            Then output:
            ```
            **Commit**: [SHA]
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
            ```

            If blocked (requirements unclear):
            ```
            <phase_blocked>
            reason: [what's unclear]
            needs: [what clarification is needed]
            </phase_blocked>
            ```

            3. Write/update tests alongside code (as specified in Testing Requirements)
            4. Run tests and fix any failures
            5. Self-review against success criteria before completing

            ### Self-Review Checklist
