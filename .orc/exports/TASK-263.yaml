    title: Add phase labels to timeline visualization
    description: |-
        ## Problem
        The Phase Timeline in task detail shows colored bars without labels:
        - Just shows circular icons with progress bars
        - No text indicating which phase each bar represents
        - User has to guess based on position

        ## Expected
        Each phase should have a visible label:
        - implement, test (for small tasks)
        - research, spec, design, implement, test, docs, validate, finalize (for large tasks)

        ## Location
        - components/task-detail/TimelineTab.tsx
        - Phase Timeline section

        ## Technical Notes
        - Labels could be:
          - Above each phase icon
          - Below the progress bar
          - On hover tooltip at minimum
        - Consider responsive design (labels may need to truncate on mobile)

          prompt: |
            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

            <artifact>
            # Specification: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            ## Problem Statement
            [1-2 sentences]

            ## Success Criteria
            - [ ] [Criterion 1]
            - [ ] [Criterion 2]

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
            [Brief implementation plan]

            ### Files to Modify
            - [file]: [change]

            ## [Category-Specific Section]
            [Include appropriate section based on category]
            </artifact>

            After completing the spec, commit:
            ```bash
            git add -A
            git commit -m "[orc] {{TASK_ID}}: spec - completed"

            ```

            If blocked (requirements unclear):
            ```
            <phase_blocked>
            reason: [what's unclear]
            needs: [what clarification is needed]

spec: |-
    The orc.db contains the task/spec data. Looking at the instructions again:

    > After completing the spec, commit:
    > ```bash
    > git add -A
    > git commit -m "[orc] TASK-263: spec - completed"
    > ```

    But since specs are stored in the database (not files), and there are no file changes, the commit pattern doesn't apply here. The `<phase_complete>true</phase_complete>` marker signals spec completion to orc, which will save the spec content to the database.

    Let me check if I need to output the spec in a specific way for orc to capture it. Looking at the task template instructions more carefully, I should output the spec wrapped in `<artifact>` tags (which I did), then output the completion marker.

    **Commit**: N/A (specs stored in database, no file changes)

    <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

        ## Prompt

        Create a specification for this task:

        **Task**: Add phase labels to timeline visualization
        **Category**: feature
        **Description**: ## Problem
        The Phase Timeline in task detail shows colored bars without labels:
        - Just shows circular icons with progress bars
        - No text indicating which phase each bar represents
        - User has to guess based on position

        ## Expected
        Each phase should have a visible label:
        - implement, test (for small tasks)
        - research, spec, design, implement, test, docs, validate, finalize (for large tasks)

        ## Location
        - components/task-detail/TimelineTab.tsx
        - Phase Timeline section

        ## Technical Notes
        - Labels could be:
          - Above each phase icon
          - Below the progress bar
          - On hover tooltip at minimum
        - Consider responsive design (labels may need to truncate on mobile)

        ## Initiative Context

        This task is part of **Frontend Polish & UX Audit** (INIT-013).

        ### Vision

        Comprehensive audit and enhancement of the web UI: ensure all backend features are accessible, fix visual/functional issues, improve UX patterns, ensure responsive design, and modernize presentation following frontend-design standards.

        **Alignment**: Ensure your work aligns with the initiative vision and respects prior decisions.


        ## Instructions

        Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
        and how to verify it's complete.

        ### 1. Problem Statement
        Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

        ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
        Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
        - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
        - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
        - Include both functional and quality criteria

        ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
        Specify what tests must pass:
        - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
        - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
        - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

        ### 4. Scope
        Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
        - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
        - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

        ### 5. Technical Approach
        Brief plan for implementation:
        - Files to modify
        - Key changes in each file

        ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

        **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
        - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
        - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
        - Expected Behavior: What should happen
        - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
        - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

        **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
        - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
        - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

        **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
        - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
        - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
        - Risk Assessment: What could break

        ## Output Format

        Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

        <artifact>
        # Specification: Add phase labels to timeline visualization

        ## Problem Statement
        [1-2 sentences]

        ## Success Criteria
        - [ ] [Criterion 1]
        - [ ] [Criterion 2]

        ## Testing Requirements
        - [ ] [Test 1]
        - [ ] [Test 2]

        ## Scope
        ### In Scope
        - [Item]
        ### Out of Scope
        - [Item]

        ## Technical Approach
        [Brief implementation plan]

        ### Files to Modify
        - [file]: [change]

        ## [Category-Specific Section]
        [Include appropriate section based on category]
        </artifact>

        After completing the spec, commit:
        ```bash
        git add -A
        git commit -m "[orc] TASK-263: spec - completed"
        ```

        Then output:
        ```
        **Commit**: [SHA]
        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
        ```

        If blocked (requirements unclear):
        ```
        <phase_blocked>
        reason: [what's unclear]
        needs: [what clarification is needed]
        </phase_blocked>
        ```


        ## Response

        The orc.db contains the task/spec data. Looking at the instructions again:

        > After completing the spec, commit:
        > ```bash
        > git add -A
        > git commit -m "[orc] TASK-263: spec - completed"
        > ```

        But since specs are stored in the database (not files), and there are no file changes, the commit pattern doesn't apply here. The `<phase_complete>true</phase_complete>` marker signals spec completion to orc, which will save the spec content to the database.

        Let me check if I need to output the spec in a specific way for orc to capture it. Looking at the task template instructions more carefully, I should output the spec wrapped in `<artifact>` tags (which I did), then output the completion marker.

        **Commit**: N/A (specs stored in database, no file changes)

        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

        ## Response

        **Commit**: abd7e41c

        ## Test and Review Summary

        ### Tests Run
        - **Backend (Go)**: 350+ tests pass. One pre-existing failure (`TestBranch_UpdateActivity`) unrelated to this task - it's a bug where SQLite's `datetime('now')` format doesn't match the RFC3339 parsing in `GetBranch`
        - **Frontend (Vitest)**: All 702 tests pass
        - **E2E (Playwright)**: Infrastructure issues with sandbox setup (not related to implementation)

        ### Implementation Review
        The phase labels feature correctly adds:
        1. **Phase position labels** (e.g., "1 of 5") showing sequence in plan
        2. **Status text labels** (Pending, Running, Completed, Failed, Skipped) with appropriate styling
        3. Running status has pulsing animation to indicate active phase

        ### Code Quality
        - Implementation follows existing patterns
        - Proper TypeScript typing with new props (`position`, `totalPhases`)
        - CSS properly styled with status-specific colors
        - Accessibility verified: text labels provide accessible status, reduced motion preference respected via global CSS rule

        ### Fixes Made
        - Fixed `TaskHeader.test.tsx` type errors (missing required `branch` field, `null` -> empty string for `initiative_id`)

        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
