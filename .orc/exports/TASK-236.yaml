            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

    # Specification: Fix concurrent finalize race condition

    ## Problem Statement
    The `handleFinalizeTask` and `TriggerFinalizeOnApproval` functions have a Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition where concurrent requests can both pass the "finalize already running" check and spawn duplicate finalize operations for the same task.

    ## Success Criteria
    - [ ] Concurrent finalize requests for the same task result in only one operation starting
    - [ ] The second concurrent request receives "already in progress" response (not 500 error)
    - [ ] Existing tests continue to pass
    - [ ] New race condition test passes with `-race` flag
    - [ ] No deadlocks introduced (verified by test timeout)

    ## Testing Requirements
    - [ ] Unit test: `TestHandleFinalizeTask_ConcurrentRequests` - verify only one finalize starts when 10+ concurrent requests arrive
    - [ ] Unit test: `TestTriggerFinalizeOnApproval_ConcurrentCalls` - verify only one triggers when called concurrently
    - [ ] Race detector: All tests pass with `go test -race`

    ## Scope
    ### In Scope
    - Add atomic check-and-set method to `finalizeTracker` for thread-safe start
    - Refactor `handleFinalizeTask` to use atomic start
    - Refactor `TriggerFinalizeOnApproval` to use atomic start
    - Add concurrent request tests

    ### Out of Scope
    - Changing the finalize execution logic itself
    - Modifying FinalizeState struct fields
    - Adding distributed locking (multi-server scenario)
    - Changing the cleanup or cancellation logic

    ## Technical Approach
    The fix uses a well-established pattern: atomic compare-and-swap via a single locked method that checks state and sets it in one critical section.

    ### Files to Modify
    - `internal/api/handlers_finalize.go`:
      - Add `tryStart(taskID string, state *FinalizeState) bool` method to `finalizeTracker`
      - Refactor `handleFinalizeTask` to use `tryStart` instead of separate get/set
      - Refactor `TriggerFinalizeOnApproval` to use `tryStart`
    - `internal/api/handlers_finalize_test.go`:
      - Add `TestHandleFinalizeTask_ConcurrentRequests`
      - Add `TestTriggerFinalizeOnApproval_ConcurrentCalls`
      - Add `TestFinalizeTrackerTryStart`

    ## Bug Analysis

    ### Reproduction Steps
    1. Send two or more concurrent POST requests to `/api/tasks/{id}/finalize` for the same task
    2. Both requests pass the "already running" check at line 213 before either sets state at line 253
    3. Both requests start separate finalize goroutines

    ### Current Behavior
    Race window between lines 213-253 in `handleFinalizeTask`:
    ```go
    // Line 213: Check (releases lock)
    if existing := finTracker.get(taskID); existing != nil {
        // ...
    }
    // ... 40 lines of non-atomic code ...
    // Line 253: Set (acquires new lock)
    finTracker.set(taskID, finState)
    ```
    Both requests can pass the check and both will set state + spawn goroutines.

    ### Expected Behavior
    Only the first request should start finalize; subsequent concurrent requests should receive "already in progress" response.

    ### Root Cause
    Separate `get` and `set` operations with lock release between them creates a TOCTOU race. The check and the state modification must be atomic.

    ### Verification
    1. Run `go test -race ./internal/api/... -run TestFinalize` - no race warnings
    2. Run new concurrent tests - verify only one operation starts
    3. Existing tests continue to pass

        **Commit**: a15c2c2d

        ## Summary

        I've tested and reviewed the implementation for fixing the concurrent finalize race condition:

        **All Testing Requirements Satisfied:**
        - `TestFinalizeTrackerTryStart` - Verifies atomic check-and-set behavior (6 sub-tests)
        - `TestHandleFinalizeTask_ConcurrentRequests` - Verifies 20 concurrent API requests all get "already in progress"
        - `TestTriggerFinalizeOnApproval_ConcurrentCalls` - Verifies 20 concurrent trigger calls don't spawn duplicates
        - Race detector: All tests pass with `go test -race`

        **Code Quality:**
        - Removed unused `createTestServerWithContext` helper function
        - Go vet passes with no warnings
        - Thread safety verified with `-race` flag

        **Implementation Review:**
        - `tryStart()` method properly implements atomic compare-and-swap
        - Context cancellation is handled at multiple checkpoints
        - Retry after completion/failure is correctly allowed
        - All map operations protected by mutex

        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
