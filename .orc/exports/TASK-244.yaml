    # Specification: UX: Add progress indication during spec phase execution

    ## Problem Statement
    When running the spec phase, users see no visual feedback about what's happening until the phase completes. This creates uncertainty about whether the task is progressing, especially during the longer spec phases where Claude is analyzing the codebase and writing a detailed specification.

    ## Project Context

    ### Patterns to Follow

    | Pattern | Example Location | How to Apply |
    |---------|------------------|--------------|
    | Event publishing | `internal/executor/standard.go:218-234` | Use existing `publisher.Activity()`, `publisher.Heartbeat()`, `publisher.TranscriptChunk()` patterns |
    | Activity tracking | `internal/executor/activity.go` | Use `ActivityTracker` for state transitions |
    | Progress display | `internal/progress/display.go` | Extend `Display` type with spec-specific progress methods |
    | CLI publisher | `internal/events/cli_publisher.go` | Handle new event types for CLI output |
    | WebSocket events | `internal/events/types.go` | Define new event data structures |

    ### Affected Code

    | File | Current Behavior | After This Change |
    |------|------------------|-------------------|
    | `internal/executor/standard.go` | Publishes phase_start, transcript, activity events | Adds spec-phase-specific progress events |
    | `internal/progress/display.go` | Shows generic "Waiting for API" and heartbeats | Shows spec-specific progress stages |
    | `internal/events/cli_publisher.go` | Handles activity/heartbeat/transcript events | Handles spec progress events |
    | `web/src/components/board/TaskCard.tsx` | Shows phase name only during execution | Shows spec progress stage indicator |

    ### Breaking Changes
    - [x] Backward compatible - new events are additive, existing behavior unchanged

    ## Success Criteria

    | ID | Criterion | Verification Method | Expected Result | Error Path |
    |----|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|
    | SC-1 | CLI shows "Analyzing codebase..." during spec phase | Run `orc run TASK-XXX` on a task with spec phase, observe stdout | Shows progress message within 5s of phase start | If no message, display generic "Processing..." |
    | SC-2 | CLI shows "Writing specification..." progress stage | Run `orc run TASK-XXX` with `--stream` flag | Shows stage transition message | Falls back to transcript-only display |
    | SC-3 | Web UI TaskCard shows spec progress indicator | Run task in web UI, observe TaskCard component | Shows "Analyzing..." or "Writing spec..." subtext under phase name | Falls back to phase name only |
    | SC-4 | Heartbeat dots continue during spec phase | Run spec phase for >30 seconds | Dots appear every 30s during API wait | Silent if no activity (existing behavior) |
    | SC-5 | TranscriptTab shows streaming content during spec | Open task detail during spec execution | Live streaming content appears | Falls back to "Streaming..." placeholder |
    | SC-6 | Activity events publish with spec-specific states | Subscribe to WebSocket, observe events | `activity` events contain `spec_analyzing` or `spec_writing` | Falls back to generic `waiting_api` |

    ## Testing Requirements

    | Test Type | Description | Command |
    |-----------|-------------|---------|
    | Unit | EventPublisher emits spec progress events | `go test ./internal/executor -run TestEventPublisher_SpecProgress` |
    | Unit | Display.SpecProgress formats output correctly | `go test ./internal/progress -run TestDisplay_SpecProgress` |
    | Unit | CLIPublisher handles activity events for spec | `go test ./internal/events -run TestCLIPublisher_SpecActivity` |
    | Integration | End-to-end spec phase shows progress | `go test ./internal/executor -run TestStandardExecutor_SpecProgress` |
    | E2E | Web UI shows spec progress | `npm run e2e -- --grep "spec progress"` |

    ## Scope

    ### In Scope
    - CLI progress indicators during spec phase
    - Web UI progress indicators during spec phase
    - New activity states: `spec_analyzing`, `spec_writing`
    - Heartbeat continuation during spec execution
    - Streaming transcript display for spec output

    ### Out of Scope
    - Progress bars with percentage completion (spec duration is unpredictable)
    - Detailed step-by-step progress (e.g., "Reading file X")
    - Cancel/pause functionality changes
    - Other phase progress enhancements (implement, test, etc.)

    ## Technical Approach

    The spec phase is long-running and has two distinct stages:
    1. **Analyzing**: Claude reads the codebase, researches patterns, identifies affected files
    2. **Writing**: Claude writes the specification document

    We'll add phase-specific activity states that the executor publishes, which both CLI and web UI can render appropriately.

    ### Files to Modify

    - `internal/executor/activity.go`: Add `ActivitySpecAnalyzing`, `ActivitySpecWriting` states
    - `internal/executor/standard.go`: Detect spec phase and publish stage-specific activity
    - `internal/events/types.go`: Add spec progress data to `ActivityUpdate` struct
    - `internal/events/cli_publisher.go`: Handle spec activity states with distinct messages
    - `internal/progress/display.go`: Add `SpecProgress(stage string)` method
    - `web/src/lib/types.ts`: Add spec progress types
    - `web/src/components/board/TaskCard.tsx`: Render spec progress indicator

    ### New Files
    - None required

    ## Feature Definition

    ### User Story
    As a developer running orc, I want to see visual feedback during the spec phase so that I know the task is making progress and understand what Claude is currently doing.

    ### Acceptance Criteria
    - [ ] Running `orc run TASK-XXX` on a large weight task shows "Analyzing codebase..." within 5 seconds
    - [ ] The message updates to "Writing specification..." when Claude starts outputting the spec
    - [ ] Heartbeat dots continue to appear every 30 seconds during long API calls
    - [ ] Web UI TaskCard shows current spec stage under the phase name
    - [ ] TranscriptTab shows streaming spec content in real-time

    ## Failure Modes

    | Failure Scenario | Expected Behavior | User Feedback | Test |
    |------------------|-------------------|---------------|------|
    | Publisher is nil | Skip publishing, continue execution | No progress shown (silent degradation) | TestStandardExecutor_NilPublisher |
    | WebSocket disconnected | CLI continues normally | CLI shows progress, web reconnects | E2E WebSocket reconnection |
    | Spec phase fails mid-execution | Normal error handling | Error message with phase context | TestStandardExecutor_SpecError |
    | Activity callback panics | Recover, log warning, continue | Degraded progress display | TestActivityTracker_CallbackPanic |

    ## Edge Cases

    | Input/State | Expected Behavior | Test |
    |-------------|-------------------|------|
    | Trivial weight task (no spec) | No spec progress shown | Unit test: skip for trivial |
    | Spec phase skipped (artifact exists) | No progress events for skipped phase | Unit test: artifact skip |
    | Very fast spec completion (<5s) | May not show all stages | Integration test: fast completion |
    | Multiple concurrent tasks | Each task publishes own events | Integration test: concurrent |
    | Quiet mode enabled | No CLI progress output | Unit test: quiet mode |

        # docs - Iteration 1

        ## Prompt

        Update documentation for:

        **Task**: UX: Add progress indication during spec phase execution
        **Category**: feature

        ## Specification

        # Specification: UX: Add progress indication during spec phase execution

        ## Problem Statement
        When running the spec phase, users see no visual feedback about what's happening until the phase completes. This creates uncertainty about whether the task is progressing, especially during the longer spec phases where Claude is analyzing the codebase and writing a detailed specification.

        ## Project Context

        ### Patterns to Follow

        | Pattern | Example Location | How to Apply |
        |---------|------------------|--------------|
        | Event publishing | `internal/executor/standard.go:218-234` | Use existing `publisher.Activity()`, `publisher.Heartbeat()`, `publisher.TranscriptChunk()` patterns |
        | Activity tracking | `internal/executor/activity.go` | Use `ActivityTracker` for state transitions |
        | Progress display | `internal/progress/display.go` | Extend `Display` type with spec-specific progress methods |
        | CLI publisher | `internal/events/cli_publisher.go` | Handle new event types for CLI output |
        | WebSocket events | `internal/events/types.go` | Define new event data structures |

        ### Affected Code

        | File | Current Behavior | After This Change |
        |------|------------------|-------------------|
        | `internal/executor/standard.go` | Publishes phase_start, transcript, activity events | Adds spec-phase-specific progress events |
        | `internal/progress/display.go` | Shows generic "Waiting for API" and heartbeats | Shows spec-specific progress stages |
        | `internal/events/cli_publisher.go` | Handles activity/heartbeat/transcript events | Handles spec progress events |
        | `web/src/components/board/TaskCard.tsx` | Shows phase name only during execution | Shows spec progress stage indicator |

        ### Breaking Changes
        - [x] Backward compatible - new events are additive, existing behavior unchanged

        ## Success Criteria

        | ID | Criterion | Verification Method | Expected Result | Error Path |
        |----|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|
        | SC-1 | CLI shows "Analyzing codebase..." during spec phase | Run `orc run TASK-XXX` on a task with spec phase, observe stdout | Shows progress message within 5s of phase start | If no message, display generic "Processing..." |
        | SC-2 | CLI shows "Writing specification..." progress stage | Run `orc run TASK-XXX` with `--stream` flag | Shows stage transition message | Falls back to transcript-only display |
        | SC-3 | Web UI TaskCard shows spec progress indicator | Run task in web UI, observe TaskCard component | Shows "Analyzing..." or "Writing spec..." subtext under phase name | Falls back to phase name only |
        | SC-4 | Heartbeat dots continue during spec phase | Run spec phase for >30 seconds | Dots appear every 30s during API wait | Silent if no activity (existing behavior) |
        | SC-5 | TranscriptTab shows streaming content during spec | Open task detail during spec execution | Live streaming content appears | Falls back to "Streaming..." placeholder |
        | SC-6 | Activity events publish with spec-specific states | Subscribe to WebSocket, observe events | `activity` events contain `spec_analyzing` or `spec_writing` | Falls back to generic `waiting_api` |

        ## Testing Requirements

        | Test Type | Description | Command |
        |-----------|-------------|---------|
        | Unit | EventPublisher emits spec progress events | `go test ./internal/executor -run TestEventPublisher_SpecProgress` |
        | Unit | Display.SpecProgress formats output correctly | `go test ./internal/progress -run TestDisplay_SpecProgress` |
        | Unit | CLIPublisher handles activity events for spec | `go test ./internal/events -run TestCLIPublisher_SpecActivity` |
        | Integration | End-to-end spec phase shows progress | `go test ./internal/executor -run TestStandardExecutor_SpecProgress` |
        | E2E | Web UI shows spec progress | `npm run e2e -- --grep "spec progress"` |

        ## Scope

        ### In Scope
        - CLI progress indicators during spec phase
        - Web UI progress indicators during spec phase
        - New activity states: `spec_analyzing`, `spec_writing`
        - Heartbeat continuation during spec execution
        - Streaming transcript display for spec output

        ### Out of Scope
        - Progress bars with percentage completion (spec duration is unpredictable)
        - Detailed step-by-step progress (e.g., "Reading file X")
        - Cancel/pause functionality changes
        - Other phase progress enhancements (implement, test, etc.)

        ## Technical Approach

        The spec phase is long-running and has two distinct stages:
        1. **Analyzing**: Claude reads the codebase, researches patterns, identifies affected files
        2. **Writing**: Claude writes the specification document

        We'll add phase-specific activity states that the executor publishes, which both CLI and web UI can render appropriately.

        ### Files to Modify

        - `internal/executor/activity.go`: Add `ActivitySpecAnalyzing`, `ActivitySpecWriting` states
        - `internal/executor/standard.go`: Detect spec phase and publish stage-specific activity
        - `internal/events/types.go`: Add spec progress data to `ActivityUpdate` struct
        - `internal/events/cli_publisher.go`: Handle spec activity states with distinct messages
        - `internal/progress/display.go`: Add `SpecProgress(stage string)` method
        - `web/src/lib/types.ts`: Add spec progress types
        - `web/src/components/board/TaskCard.tsx`: Render spec progress indicator

        ### New Files
        - None required

        ## Feature Definition

        ### User Story
        As a developer running orc, I want to see visual feedback during the spec phase so that I know the task is making progress and understand what Claude is currently doing.

        ### Acceptance Criteria
        - [ ] Running `orc run TASK-XXX` on a large weight task shows "Analyzing codebase..." within 5 seconds
        - [ ] The message updates to "Writing specification..." when Claude starts outputting the spec
        - [ ] Heartbeat dots continue to appear every 30 seconds during long API calls
        - [ ] Web UI TaskCard shows current spec stage under the phase name
        - [ ] TranscriptTab shows streaming spec content in real-time

        ## Failure Modes

        | Failure Scenario | Expected Behavior | User Feedback | Test |
        |------------------|-------------------|---------------|------|
        | Publisher is nil | Skip publishing, continue execution | No progress shown (silent degradation) | TestStandardExecutor_NilPublisher |
        | WebSocket disconnected | CLI continues normally | CLI shows progress, web reconnects | E2E WebSocket reconnection |
        | Spec phase fails mid-execution | Normal error handling | Error message with phase context | TestStandardExecutor_SpecError |
        | Activity callback panics | Recover, log warning, continue | Degraded progress display | TestActivityTracker_CallbackPanic |

        ## Edge Cases

        | Input/State | Expected Behavior | Test |
        |-------------|-------------------|------|
        | Trivial weight task (no spec) | No spec progress shown | Unit test: skip for trivial |
        | Spec phase skipped (artifact exists) | No progress events for skipped phase | Unit test: artifact skip |
        | Very fast spec completion (<5s) | May not show all stages | Integration test: fast completion |
        | Multiple concurrent tasks | Each task publishes own events | Integration test: concurrent |
        | Quiet mode enabled | No CLI progress output | Unit test: quiet mode |

        |------|------------------|-------------------|
        | `internal/executor/standard.go` | Publishes phase_start, transcript, activity events | Adds spec-phase-specific progress events |
        | `internal/progress/display.go` | Shows generic "Waiting for API" and heartbeats | Shows spec-specific progress stages |
        | `internal/events/cli_publisher.go` | Handles activity/heartbeat/transcript events | Handles spec progress events |
        | `web/src/components/board/TaskCard.tsx` | Shows phase name only during execution | Shows spec progress stage indicator |

        ### Breaking Changes
        - [x] Backward compatible - new events are additive, existing behavior unchanged

        ## Success Criteria

        | ID | Criterion | Verification Method | Expected Result | Error Path |
        |----|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|
        | SC-1 | CLI shows "Analyzing codebase..." during spec phase | Run `orc run TASK-XXX` on a task with spec phase, observe stdout | Shows progress message within 5s of phase start | If no message, display generic "Processing..." |
        | SC-2 | CLI shows "Writing specification..." progress stage | Run `orc run TASK-XXX` with `--stream` flag | Shows stage transition message | Falls back to transcript-only display |
        | SC-3 | Web UI TaskCard shows spec progress indicator | Run task in web UI, observe TaskCard component | Shows "Analyzing..." or "Writing spec..." subtext under phase name | Falls back to phase name only |
        | SC-4 | Heartbeat dots continue during spec phase | Run spec phase for >30 seconds | Dots appear every 30s during API wait | Silent if no activity (existing behavior) |
        | SC-5 | TranscriptTab shows streaming content during spec | Open task detail during spec execution | Live streaming content appears | Falls back to "Streaming..." placeholder |
        | SC-6 | Activity events publish with spec-specific states | Subscribe to WebSocket, observe events | `activity` events contain `spec_analyzing` or `spec_writing` | Falls back to generic `waiting_api` |

        ## Testing Requirements

        | Test Type | Description | Command |
        |-----------|-------------|---------|
        | Unit | EventPublisher emits spec progress events | `go test ./internal/executor -run TestEventPublisher_SpecProgress` |
        | Unit | Display.SpecProgress formats output correctly | `go test ./internal/progress -run TestDisplay_SpecProgress` |
        | Unit | CLIPublisher handles activity events for spec | `go test ./internal/events -run TestCLIPublisher_SpecActivity` |
        | Integration | End-to-end spec phase shows progress | `go test ./internal/executor -run TestStandardExecutor_SpecProgress` |
        | E2E | Web UI shows spec progress | `npm run e2e -- --grep "spec progress"` |

        ## Scope

        ### In Scope
        - CLI progress indicators during spec phase
        - Web UI progress indicators during spec phase
        - New activity states: `spec_analyzing`, `spec_writing`
        - Heartbeat continuation during spec execution
        - Streaming transcript display for spec output

        ### Out of Scope
        - Progress bars with percentage completion (spec duration is unpredictable)
        - Detailed step-by-step progress (e.g., "Reading file X")
        - Cancel/pause functionality changes
        - Other phase progress enhancements (implement, test, etc.)

        ## Technical Approach

        The spec phase is long-running and has two distinct stages:
        1. **Analyzing**: Claude reads the codebase, researches patterns, identifies affected files
        2. **Writing**: Claude writes the specification document

        We'll add phase-specific activity states that the executor publishes, which both CLI and web UI can render appropriately.

        ### Files to Modify

        - `internal/executor/activity.go`: Add `ActivitySpecAnalyzing`, `ActivitySpecWriting` states
        - `internal/executor/standard.go`: Detect spec phase and publish stage-specific activity
        - `internal/events/types.go`: Add spec progress data to `ActivityUpdate` struct
        - `internal/events/cli_publisher.go`: Handle spec activity states with distinct messages
        - `internal/progress/display.go`: Add `SpecProgress(stage string)` method
        - `web/src/lib/types.ts`: Add spec progress types
        - `web/src/components/board/TaskCard.tsx`: Render spec progress indicator

        ### New Files
        - None required

        ## Feature Definition

        ### User Story
        As a developer running orc, I want to see visual feedback during the spec phase so that I know the task is making progress and understand what Claude is currently doing.

        ### Acceptance Criteria
        - [ ] Running `orc run TASK-XXX` on a large weight task shows "Analyzing codebase..." within 5 seconds
        - [ ] The message updates to "Writing specification..." when Claude starts outputting the spec
        - [ ] Heartbeat dots continue to appear every 30 seconds during long API calls
        - [ ] Web UI TaskCard shows current spec stage under the phase name
        - [ ] TranscriptTab shows streaming spec content in real-time

        ## Failure Modes

        | Failure Scenario | Expected Behavior | User Feedback | Test |
        |------------------|-------------------|---------------|------|
        | Publisher is nil | Skip publishing, continue execution | No progress shown (silent degradation) | TestStandardExecutor_NilPublisher |
        | WebSocket disconnected | CLI continues normally | CLI shows progress, web reconnects | E2E WebSocket reconnection |
        | Spec phase fails mid-execution | Normal error handling | Error message with phase context | TestStandardExecutor_SpecError |
        | Activity callback panics | Recover, log warning, continue | Degraded progress display | TestActivityTracker_CallbackPanic |

        ## Edge Cases

        | Input/State | Expected Behavior | Test |
        |-------------|-------------------|------|
        | Trivial weight task (no spec) | No spec progress shown | Unit test: skip for trivial |
        | Spec phase skipped (artifact exists) | No progress events for skipped phase | Unit test: artifact skip |
        | Very fast spec completion (<5s) | May not show all stages | Integration test: fast completion |
        | Multiple concurrent tasks | Each task publishes own events | Integration test: concurrent |
        | Quiet mode enabled | No CLI progress output | Unit test: quiet mode |

        | Trivial weight task (no spec) | No spec progress shown | Unit test: skip for trivial |
        | Spec phase skipped (artifact exists) | No progress events for skipped phase | Unit test: artifact skip |
        | Very fast spec completion (<5s) | May not show all stages | Integration test: fast completion |
        | Multiple concurrent tasks | Each task publishes own events | Integration test: concurrent |
        | Quiet mode enabled | No CLI progress output | Unit test: quiet mode |
