    title: Initiative detail 'Back to Tasks' should link to filtered board view
    description: |-
        ## Problem
        On the Initiative Detail page (/initiatives/:id), the 'Back to Tasks' link goes to the root tasks list (/).

        ## Expected
        The back link should go to the board filtered by the current initiative:
        - /board?initiative=INIT-013 (for INIT-013)

        This would provide better context when navigating back.

        ## Alternative Options
        1. Link to board with initiative filter (recommended)
        2. Link to tasks list with initiative filter (/?initiative=INIT-013)
        3. Use browser back button behavior (may be confusing)

        ## Location
        - pages/InitiativeDetail.tsx

        ## Technical Notes
        - Simple href change
        - Use initiative.id from current context

          prompt: |
            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

            <artifact>
            # Specification: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            ## Problem Statement
            [1-2 sentences]

            ## Success Criteria
            - [ ] [Criterion 1]
            - [ ] [Criterion 2]

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
            [Brief implementation plan]

            ### Files to Modify
            - [file]: [change]

            ## [Category-Specific Section]
            [Include appropriate section based on category]
            </artifact>

            After completing the spec, commit:
            ```bash
            git add -A
            git commit -m "[orc] {{TASK_ID}}: spec - completed"
            ```

            Then output:

            ```

            If blocked (requirements unclear):
            ```
            <phase_blocked>
            reason: [what's unclear]
            needs: [what clarification is needed]
            </phase_blocked>
            ```

    The working tree is clean - there are no file changes to commit for a spec phase on a simple feature like this. The specification I wrote is in my response and would be captured by orc.

    Since the instructions say to commit and there's nothing to commit, I should acknowledge this is a spec-only task with no source changes, and signal phase completion.

    **Commit**: N/A (no file changes - spec content provided in response)

        ## Response

        **Commit**: c849962e

        **Summary of changes:**
        - `web/src/pages/InitiativeDetail.tsx`: Changed the "Back to Tasks" link to navigate to `/board?initiative=${initiative.id}` instead of `/`, so users return to a filtered board view showing only tasks for the current initiative
        - `web/src/pages/InitiativeDetail.tsx`: Changed the error state "Back to Tasks" link to `/board` (since the initiative ID is not available when the initiative is not found)
        - `web/src/pages/InitiativeDetail.test.tsx`: Added a new test verifying the back link href points to the filtered board view

        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

        # spec - Iteration 1

        ## Prompt

        Create a specification for this task:

        **Task**: Initiative detail 'Back to Tasks' should link to filtered board view
        **Category**: feature
        **Description**: ## Problem
        On the Initiative Detail page (/initiatives/:id), the 'Back to Tasks' link goes to the root tasks list (/).

        ## Expected
        The back link should go to the board filtered by the current initiative:
        - /board?initiative=INIT-013 (for INIT-013)

        This would provide better context when navigating back.

        ## Alternative Options
        1. Link to board with initiative filter (recommended)
        2. Link to tasks list with initiative filter (/?initiative=INIT-013)
        3. Use browser back button behavior (may be confusing)

        ## Location
        - pages/InitiativeDetail.tsx

        ## Technical Notes
        - Simple href change
        - Use initiative.id from current context

        ## Initiative Context

        This task is part of **Frontend Polish & UX Audit** (INIT-013).

        ### Vision

        Comprehensive audit and enhancement of the web UI: ensure all backend features are accessible, fix visual/functional issues, improve UX patterns, ensure responsive design, and modernize presentation following frontend-design standards.

        **Alignment**: Ensure your work aligns with the initiative vision and respects prior decisions.


        ## Instructions

        Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
        and how to verify it's complete.

        ### 1. Problem Statement
        Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

        ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
        Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
        - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
        - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
        - Include both functional and quality criteria

        ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
        Specify what tests must pass:
        - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
        - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
        - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

        ### 4. Scope
        Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
        - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
        - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

        ### 5. Technical Approach
        Brief plan for implementation:
        - Files to modify
        - Key changes in each file

        ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

        **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
        - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
        - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
        - Expected Behavior: What should happen
        - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
        - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

        **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
        - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
        - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

        **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
        - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
        - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
        - Risk Assessment: What could break

        ## Output Format

        Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

        <artifact>
        # Specification: Initiative detail 'Back to Tasks' should link to filtered board view

        ## Problem Statement

        - [ ] [Test 2]

        ## Scope
        ### In Scope
        - [Item]
        ### Out of Scope
        - [Item]

        ## Technical Approach

        After completing the spec, commit:
        ```bash
        git add -A
        git commit -m "[orc] TASK-268: spec - completed"
        ```

        Then output:
        ```
        **Commit**: [SHA]
        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
        ```

        If blocked (requirements unclear):
        ```
        <phase_blocked>
        reason: [what's unclear]
        needs: [what clarification is needed]
        </phase_blocked>
        ```


        ## Response

        The working tree is clean - there are no file changes to commit for a spec phase on a simple feature like this. The specification I wrote is in my response and would be captured by orc.

        Since the instructions say to commit and there's nothing to commit, I should acknowledge this is a spec-only task with no source changes, and signal phase completion.

        **Commit**: N/A (no file changes - spec content provided in response)

        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
