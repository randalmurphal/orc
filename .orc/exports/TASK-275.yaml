    title: 'Fix: View mode dropdown disabled on Board page - can''t switch to swimlane view'
    description: |-
        ## Problem
        On the Board page, the View Mode dropdown is disabled and shows 'Flat'.
        Users cannot switch to the 'By Initiative' swimlane view.

        ## Current Behavior
        - Dropdown trigger shows 'Flat' with disabled state
        - Cannot click to open dropdown
        - Cannot select 'By Initiative' option

        ## Expected Behavior
        - Dropdown should be enabled when no initiative filter is active
        - Dropdown should allow switching between 'Flat' and 'By Initiative' views
        - CLAUDE.md notes: 'Swimlane disabled when initiative filter active' - but it's disabled even without filter

        ## Testing Performed
        - Navigated to /board (no initiative filter in URL)
        - View mode dropdown was disabled

        ## Location
        - components/board/ViewModeDropdown.tsx
        - pages/Board.tsx (where disabled prop is passed)

        ## Technical Notes
        - Check if disabled prop is being set incorrectly
        - May be tied to initiative filter state logic

          prompt: |
            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
            [Brief implementation plan]

            ### Files to Modify

        ## Response

        TASK-275 is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

        **Problem:** View mode dropdown on Board page was disabled, preventing users from switching to swimlane view even on clean URL navigation (`/board`). The root cause was that `swimlaneDisabled` used `currentInitiativeId` from the Zustand store, which included localStorage-persisted values from previous sessions.

        **Fix:** Changed `Board.tsx` (lines 83-87) to use the URL parameter as the source of truth:
        ```typescript
        // Use URL param as source of truth, not store value (which includes localStorage-persisted state)
        // This ensures clean URL navigation (/board) has dropdown enabled
        const urlInitiativeFilter = searchParams.get('initiative');
        const swimlaneDisabled = urlInitiativeFilter !== null;
        ```

        **Testing:**
        - Manual browser testing confirmed dropdown enabled on clean URL
        - New E2E test added (`should enable view mode dropdown on clean URL`) - passed
        - 25/26 E2E tests passed (the 1 failure is a pre-existing unrelated xpath issue)

        ## Prompt

        Create a specification for this task:

        **Task**: Fix: View mode dropdown disabled on Board page - can't switch to swimlane view
        **Category**: bug
        **Description**: ## Problem
        On the Board page, the View Mode dropdown is disabled and shows 'Flat'.
        Users cannot switch to the 'By Initiative' swimlane view.

        ## Current Behavior
        - Dropdown trigger shows 'Flat' with disabled state
        - Cannot click to open dropdown
        - Cannot select 'By Initiative' option

        ## Expected Behavior
        - Dropdown should be enabled when no initiative filter is active
        - Dropdown should allow switching between 'Flat' and 'By Initiative' views
        - CLAUDE.md notes: 'Swimlane disabled when initiative filter active' - but it's disabled even without filter

        ## Testing Performed
        - Navigated to /board (no initiative filter in URL)
        - View mode dropdown was disabled

        ## Location
        - components/board/ViewModeDropdown.tsx
        - pages/Board.tsx (where disabled prop is passed)

        ## Technical Notes
        - Check if disabled prop is being set incorrectly
        - May be tied to initiative filter state logic

        ## Initiative Context

        This task is part of **Frontend Polish & UX Audit** (INIT-013).

        ### Vision

        Comprehensive audit and enhancement of the web UI: ensure all backend features are accessible, fix visual/functional issues, improve UX patterns, ensure responsive design, and modernize presentation following frontend-design standards.

        **Alignment**: Ensure your work aligns with the initiative vision and respects prior decisions.


        ## Instructions

        Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
        and how to verify it's complete.

        ### 1. Problem Statement
        Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

        ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
        Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
        - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
        - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
        - Include both functional and quality criteria

        ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
        Specify what tests must pass:
        - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
        - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
        - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

        ### 4. Scope
        Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
        - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
        - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

        ### 5. Technical Approach
        Brief plan for implementation:
        - Files to modify
        - Key changes in each file

        ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

        **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
        - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
        - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
        - Expected Behavior: What should happen
        - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
        - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

        **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
        - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
        - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

        **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
        - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
        - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
        - Risk Assessment: What could break

        ## Response

        **Commit**: 1ca69c87

        ## Summary

        The test phase is complete. I verified:

        1. **E2E Tests Pass (26/26)**: All board tests pass including the new TASK-275 specific tests:
           - `should enable view mode dropdown on clean URL (ignoring localStorage initiative filter)`
           - `should disable swimlane toggle when initiative filter active in URL`
           - `should show initiative banner when filtering`

        2. **Frontend Unit Tests Pass (690/690)**: All Vitest tests pass

        3. **Backend Tests**: Pass with one pre-existing failure (`TestBranch_UpdateActivity`) that exists on main branch and is unrelated to this task

        4. **Success Criteria Verified**:
           - ✅ View Mode dropdown enabled when no initiative filter in URL
           - ✅ View Mode dropdown disabled only when URL has initiative param
           - ✅ Swimlane view accessible when filter not active
           - ✅ Initiative filter behavior documented in CLAUDE.md
           - ✅ E2E tests validate all scenarios

        5. **Code Quality**: The implementation follows the recommended Option A approach from the spec - using URL param as source of truth for `swimlaneDisabled`

        6. **Fixed Flaky Test**: Also fixed a pre-existing flaky test (`should render task cards in correct columns`) that was selecting multiple ancestor regions instead of just the column region
