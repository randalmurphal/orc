    title: Create RightPanel component (collapsible 300px panel)
    description: |-
        Create the collapsible right panel that shows blocked tasks, decisions, files changed, etc.

        REFERENCE FILES:
        - example_ui/board.html (.command-panel, lines 258-400+)
        - example_ui/Screenshot_20260116_201804.png (right side of board view)

        SUCCESS CRITERIA:
        1. RightPanel component at web/src/components/layout/RightPanel.tsx
        2. Width: 300px fixed, collapsible to 0 with animation
        3. Background: var(--bg-elevated), border-left 1px solid var(--border)
        4. Scrollable content area with custom scrollbar
        5. Section components for panel content:
           - RightPanel.Section (collapsible section with header)
           - RightPanel.Header (section title with icon and count badge)
        6. Animation: slide in/out with 0.2s transition
        7. Visibility controlled by parent (AppShell)
        8. Props: isOpen, onClose, children
        9. npm run typecheck exits 0

        EDGE CASES:
        - Panel should not render content when closed (performance)
        - Scroll position preserved when closing/opening
        - Touch gesture to swipe closed on mobile

        FILES TO CREATE:
        - web/src/components/layout/RightPanel.tsx

          name: spec
          prompt: |
            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

            <artifact>
            # Specification: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            ## Problem Statement
            [1-2 sentences]

            ## Success Criteria
            - [ ] [Criterion 1]
            - [ ] [Criterion 2]

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
            [Brief implementation plan]

            ### Files to Modify
            - [file]: [change]

            ## [Category-Specific Section]
            [Include appropriate section based on category]
            </artifact>

            After completing the spec, commit:
            ```bash
            git add -A
            git commit -m "[orc] {{TASK_ID}}: spec - completed"
            ```

            Then output:
            ```
            **Commit**: [SHA]
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
            ```

            If blocked (requirements unclear):
            ```
            <phase_blocked>
            reason: [what's unclear]
            needs: [what clarification is needed]
            </phase_blocked>

        # spec - Iteration 1

        ## Prompt

        Create a specification for this task:

        **Task**: Create RightPanel component (collapsible 300px panel)
        **Category**: feature
        **Description**: Create the collapsible right panel that shows blocked tasks, decisions, files changed, etc.

        REFERENCE FILES:
        - example_ui/board.html (.command-panel, lines 258-400+)
        - example_ui/Screenshot_20260116_201804.png (right side of board view)

        SUCCESS CRITERIA:
        1. RightPanel component at web/src/components/layout/RightPanel.tsx
        2. Width: 300px fixed, collapsible to 0 with animation
        3. Background: var(--bg-elevated), border-left 1px solid var(--border)
        4. Scrollable content area with custom scrollbar
        5. Section components for panel content:
           - RightPanel.Section (collapsible section with header)
           - RightPanel.Header (section title with icon and count badge)
        6. Animation: slide in/out with 0.2s transition
        7. Visibility controlled by parent (AppShell)
        8. Props: isOpen, onClose, children
        9. npm run typecheck exits 0

        EDGE CASES:
        - Panel should not render content when closed (performance)
        - Scroll position preserved when closing/opening
        - Touch gesture to swipe closed on mobile

        FILES TO CREATE:
        - web/src/components/layout/RightPanel.tsx
        - web/src/components/layout/RightPanel.css

        ## Initiative Context

        This task is part of **UI Redesign: Layout Shell** (INIT-016).

        ### Vision

        Build the main application shell replacing existing web/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx. The layout uses CSS Grid from example_ui/board.html.

        Grid Structure:
        - .app: display: grid; grid-template-columns: 56px 1fr; height: 100vh
        - IconNav: 56px fixed width, bg-elevated background, border-right
        - Main wrapper: flex column containing TopBar (48px) + scrollable content
        - RightPanel: 300px width, collapsible via .panel-collapsed class

        IconNav (56px sidebar):
        - Logo: 32x32px gradient background, 'O' centered
        - Nav items: icon (18px) + label (8px), vertical stack, 48px height each
        - Sections: Board, Initiatives, Stats, [divider], Agents, Settings, [bottom] Help
        - Active state: primary-dim background, primary-bright text, 2px left border

        TopBar (48px header):
        - Project dropdown (left), Search box (200px), Session metrics (center: time/tokens/cost), Actions (right: Pause, New Task, Panel toggle)

        Replace: web/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx, Sidebar.tsx, Header.tsx
        Reference: example_ui/board.html, example_ui/Screenshot_20260116_201804.png

        **Alignment**: Ensure your work aligns with the initiative vision and respects prior decisions.


        ## Instructions

        Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
        and how to verify it's complete.

        ### 1. Problem Statement
        Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

        ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
        Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
        - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
        - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
        - Include both functional and quality criteria

        ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
        Specify what tests must pass:
        - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
        - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
        - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

        ### 4. Scope
        Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
        - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
        - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

        ### 5. Technical Approach
        Brief plan for implementation:
        - Files to modify
        - Key changes in each file

        ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

        **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
        - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
        - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
        - Expected Behavior: What should happen
        - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
        - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

        **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
        - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
        - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

        **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
        - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
        - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
        - Risk Assessment: What could break

        ## Output Format

        Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

        <artifact>
        # Specification: Create RightPanel component (collapsible 300px panel)

        ## Problem Statement
        [1-2 sentences]

        ## Success Criteria
        - [ ] [Criterion 1]
        - [ ] [Criterion 2]

        ## Testing Requirements
        - [ ] [Test 1]
        - [ ] [Test 2]

        ## Scope
        ### In Scope
        - [Item]
        ### Out of Scope
        - [Item]

        ## Technical Approach
        [Brief implementation plan]

        ### Files to Modify
        - [file]: [change]

        ## [Category-Specific Section]
        [Include appropriate section based on category]
        </artifact>

        After completing the spec, commit:
        ```bash
        git add -A
        git commit -m "[orc] TASK-339: spec - completed"
        ```

        Then output:
        ```
        **Commit**: [SHA]
        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
        ```

        If blocked (requirements unclear):
        ```
        <phase_blocked>
        reason: [what's unclear]
        needs: [what clarification is needed]
        </phase_blocked>
        ```


        ## Response

        The spec file was created successfully in `.orc/tasks/TASK-339/spec.md`. Since the `.orc/tasks` directory is gitignored (by design - task artifacts are managed by orc, not git), there's no commit needed for the spec itself.

        **Commit**: N/A (spec stored in `.orc/tasks/TASK-339/spec.md`, directory is gitignored by design)

        <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
