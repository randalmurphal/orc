    phases:

          prompt: |
            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            Wrap your spec in artifact tags:

            <artifact>
            # Specification: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            ## Problem Statement
            [1-2 sentences]

            ## Success Criteria
            - [ ] [Criterion 1]
            - [ ] [Criterion 2]

            ## Testing Requirements
            - [ ] [Test 1]
            - [ ] [Test 2]

            ## Scope
            ### In Scope
            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
            - [Item]

            ## Technical Approach
            [Brief implementation plan]

            ### Files to Modify
            - [file]: [change]

            ## [Category-Specific Section]
            [Include appropriate section based on category]
            </artifact>

            After completing the spec, commit:
            ```bash
            git add -A
            git commit -m "[orc] {{TASK_ID}}: spec - completed"
            ```

            Then output:

            **Commit**: [SHA]
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
            ```

            If blocked (requirements unclear):
            ```
            <phase_blocked>
            reason: [what's unclear]
            needs: [what clarification is needed]
            </phase_blocked>
            ```

            1. Review the spec's success criteria - these are your acceptance criteria
            2. Implement the required changes following the technical approach
            3. Write/update tests alongside code (as specified in Testing Requirements)
            4. Run tests and fix any failures
            5. Self-review against success criteria before completing

            ### Self-Review Checklist

            - [ ] All testing requirements satisfied
            - [ ] Scope boundaries respected (no extra features)

        ## Response

        Documentation updated with the following changes:

        1. **docs/architecture/GIT_INTEGRATION.md** - Added new "Thread Safety" section documenting:
           - Mutex-protected operations table
           - Design principles (individual commands atomic, compound operations need protection, worktree independence)
           - Example race condition that mutex prevents
           - Worktree instance independence pattern

        2. **internal/CLAUDE.md** - Updated git package description to mention thread-safety

        3. **CLAUDE.md** - Added knowledge entry for "Git mutex for compound operations" pattern

Problem Statement\nSummarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.\n\n### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)\nDefine specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:\n- Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)\n- No vague language (\"works well\", \"is fast\")\n- Include both functional and quality criteria\n\n### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)\nSpecify what tests must pass:\n- [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]\n- [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]\n- [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]\n\n### 4. Scope\nDefine boundaries to prevent scope creep:\n- **In Scope**: What will be implemented\n- **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented\n\n### 5. Technical Approach\nBrief plan for implementation:\n- Files to modify\n- Key changes in each file\n\n### 6. Category-Specific Analysis\n\n**If this is a BUG (category=bug):**\n- Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug\n- Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)\n- Expected Behavior: What should happen\n- Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)\n- Verification: How to confirm the fix works\n\n**If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**\n- User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]\n- Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance\n\n**If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**\n- Before Pattern: Current code/architecture\n- After Pattern: Target code/architecture\n- Risk Assessment: What could break\n\n## Output Format\n\nWrap your spec in artifact tags:\n\n<artifact>\n# Specification: Add mutex to Git struct for compound operations\n\n## Problem Statement\n[1-2 sentences]\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] [Criterion 1]\n- [ ] [Criterion 2]\n\n## Testing Requirements\n- [ ] [Test 1]\n- [ ] [Test 2]\n\n## Scope\n### In Scope\n- [Item]\n### Out of Scope\n- [Item]\n\n## Technical Approach\n[Brief implementation plan]\n\n### Files to Modify\n- [file]: [change]\n\n## [Category-Specific Section]\n[Include appropriate section based on category]\n</artifact>\n\nAfter completing the spec, commit:\n```bash\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"[orc] TASK-235: spec - completed\"\n```\n\nThen output:\n```\n**Commit**: [SHA]\n<phase_complete>true</phase_complete>\n```\n\nIf blocked (requirements unclear):\n```\n<phase_blocked>\nreason: [what's unclear]\nneeds: [what clarification is needed]\n</phase_blocked>\n```\n\n\n## Response\n\nThe branch is clean because the spec is delivered in the artifact format. The spec phase is complete - the specification has been written and delivered.
