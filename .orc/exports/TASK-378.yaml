    title: Implement GET /api/stats/activity endpoint for heatmap
    description: |-
        Add GET /api/stats/activity endpoint returning 16 weeks of daily activity data for the GitHub-style heatmap in Stats view.

        **Query Parameters:**
        - weeks: number of weeks to return (default: 16, max: 52)

        **Response Schema:**
        ```json
        {
          "start_date": "2025-09-23",
          "end_date": "2026-01-16",
          "data": [
            {"date": "2025-09-23", "count": 5, "level": 2},
            {"date": "2025-09-24", "count": 0, "level": 0},
            ...
          ],
          "stats": {
            "total_tasks": 247,
            "current_streak": 12,
            "longest_streak": 45,
            "busiest_day": {"date": "2025-12-15", "count": 23}
          }
        }
        ```

        **Level calculation (0-4):**
        - 0: no tasks
        - 1: 1-2 tasks
        - 2: 3-5 tasks
        - 3: 6-10 tasks
        - 4: 11+ tasks

        **Implementation:**
        1. Create internal/api/stats.go with StatsHandler struct
        2. Query completed tasks grouped by DATE(completed_at)
        3. Fill in missing dates with count: 0
        4. Calculate streak by finding consecutive days with count > 0
        5. Register route: GET /api/stats/activity

        **Files to modify:**
        - internal/api/stats.go (create)
        - internal/api/routes.go (add route)
        - internal/db/queries.go (add date aggregation query)

        **Success criteria:**
        - Returns exactly 16 weeks (112 days) by default
        - Missing dates filled with count: 0, level: 0
        - Level calculation matches thresholds above
        - Streak calculation handles timezone correctly
        - Query is efficient (single SQL GROUP BY, not N+1)

            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break

            ## Output Format

            - [Item]
            ### Out of Scope
