    title: Modify EventPublisher to persist events to database
    description: |-
        Update the EventPublisher to save events to the new event_log table while maintaining real-time WebSocket broadcast.

        **CURRENT STATE:**
        - MemoryPublisher in internal/events/publisher.go broadcasts to in-memory channels
        - Events vanish when server restarts or connections close
        - No persistence layer

        **REQUIRED CHANGES:**

        1. **Add PersistentPublisher interface:**
        ```go
        type PersistentPublisher interface {
            Publisher
            PublishAndPersist(ctx context.Context, event Event, db *ProjectDB) error
        }
        ```

        2. **Modify Publish calls in executor:**
        - internal/executor/publish.go: Update Phase(), Transcript(), Activity(), Heartbeat(), Tokens(), Error(), Complete() to call persistence
        - Pass ProjectDB context through executor

        3. **Event to EventLog mapping:**
        ```go
        func eventToLog(e Event) EventLog {
            return EventLog{
                TaskID:    e.TaskID,
                Phase:     extractPhase(e.Data),
                Iteration: extractIteration(e.Data),
                EventType: string(e.Type),
                Data:      toJSON(e.Data),
                Source:    "executor",
                CreatedAt: e.Time,
            }
        }
        ```

        4. **Batch writes for performance:**
        - Buffer events and write in batches of 10-50
        - Flush on phase completion or every 5 seconds
        - Use transactions for batch inserts

        **FILES TO MODIFY:**
        - internal/events/publisher.go (add persistence interface)
        - internal/events/memory.go (implement PersistentPublisher)
        - internal/executor/publish.go (call PublishAndPersist)
        - internal/executor/executor.go (pass DB context)

        **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
        1. All existing WebSocket broadcasts still work
        2. Events saved to event_log table in real-time
        3. Phase completion events include duration_ms
        4. Batch writes reduce DB load (not N+1)
        5. Graceful handling if DB write fails (log error, don't crash)
        6. Events queryable after server restart

        **PERFORMANCE:**
        - Use write buffer to avoid per-line DB writes
        - Transaction batching for 10+ events
        - Don't block WebSocket broadcast on DB write

            Create a specification for this task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}
            **Category**: {{TASK_CATEGORY}}
            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{INITIATIVE_CONTEXT}}

            ## Instructions

            Create a clear, actionable specification that defines exactly what needs to be done
            and how to verify it's complete.

            ### 1. Problem Statement
            Summarize what needs to be solved in 1-2 sentences.

            ### 2. Success Criteria (REQUIRED)
            Define specific, testable criteria as checkboxes:
            - Each criterion must be verifiable (file exists, test passes, API returns X)
            - No vague language ("works well", "is fast")
            - Include both functional and quality criteria

            ### 3. Testing Requirements (REQUIRED)
            Specify what tests must pass:
            - [ ] Unit test: [specific test description]
            - [ ] Integration test: [if applicable]
            - [ ] E2E test: [if UI changes]

            ### 4. Scope
            Define boundaries to prevent scope creep:
            - **In Scope**: What will be implemented
            - **Out of Scope**: What will NOT be implemented

            ### 5. Technical Approach
            Brief plan for implementation:
            - Files to modify
            - Key changes in each file

            ### 6. Category-Specific Analysis

            **If this is a BUG (category=bug):**
            - Reproduction Steps: Exact steps to trigger the bug
            - Current Behavior: What happens now (the bug)
            - Expected Behavior: What should happen
            - Root Cause: Where the bug originates (if known)
            - Verification: How to confirm the fix works

            **If this is a FEATURE (category=feature):**
            - User Story: As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
            - Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions for feature acceptance

            **If this is a REFACTOR (category=refactor):**
            - Before Pattern: Current code/architecture
            - After Pattern: Target code/architecture
            - Risk Assessment: What could break
