    title: When something goes back to the implement phase, there should be an audit trail that explains the progress made on the ticket, with clickable items that will take you to relevant context if thats available and something that makes sense, otherwise it should just show the text display if theres nothing that it makes sense that a link will be taking you to somewhere.

            Implement the following feature/task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{RETRY_CONTEXT}}

            1. Plan your implementation approach
            2. Implement the required changes
            3. Write/update tests alongside code
            4. Run tests and fix any failures

            Keep iterating until implementation is complete and tests pass.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

            type: auto

            Test and review the implementation:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Original task**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            1. Run the full test suite
            2. Review code for quality issues
            3. Check for edge cases and security issues
            4. Fix any problems found

            Keep iterating until all tests pass and code quality is acceptable.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

            Update documentation for:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            1. Update any relevant documentation files
            2. Ensure CLAUDE.md reflects the changes if applicable
            3. Add/update code comments where needed
            4. Update README if user-facing changes were made

            Keep iterating until documentation is complete.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
