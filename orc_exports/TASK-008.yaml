    title: Task board should live refresh when tasks added via CLI or filesystem
    description: Currently the kanban board doesn't update in real-time when tasks are created via CLI or direct filesystem edits. The file watcher infrastructure exists (WebSocket events for task_created/task_updated/task_deleted) but the board may not be subscribed to these events properly. Verify the event flow from file watcher -> WebSocket -> board component and fix any gaps.

            Implement the following feature/task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{RETRY_CONTEXT}}

            1. Plan your implementation approach
            2. Implement the required changes
            3. Write/update tests alongside code
            4. Run tests and fix any failures

            Keep iterating until implementation is complete and tests pass.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
          gate:
            type: auto

            Test and review the implementation:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Original task**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            1. Run the full test suite
            2. Review code for quality issues
            3. Check for edge cases and security issues
            4. Fix any problems found

            Keep iterating until all tests pass and code quality is acceptable.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

            Update documentation for:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            1. Update any relevant documentation files
            2. Ensure CLAUDE.md reflects the changes if applicable
            3. Add/update code comments where needed
            4. Update README if user-facing changes were made

            Keep iterating until documentation is complete.
