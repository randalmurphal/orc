    title: Sync task branch with target before completion
    description: 'During task execution, the task branch should periodically or at completion sync with the target branch (main) to detect and resolve conflicts early. Currently, parallel tasks can diverge significantly, causing merge conflicts at completion. Options: 1) Sync at start of each phase, 2) Sync only at completion, 3) Detect conflicts before PR creation. This would catch issues like the TASK-014/015/016 merge conflicts before they pile up.'

            Implement the following feature/task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{RETRY_CONTEXT}}

            1. Plan your implementation approach
            2. Implement the required changes
            3. Write/update tests alongside code
            4. Run tests and fix any failures

            Keep iterating until implementation is complete and tests pass.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>
          gate:

            Test and review the implementation:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Original task**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            1. Run the full test suite
            2. Review code for quality issues
            3. Check for edge cases and security issues
            4. Fix any problems found

            Keep iterating until all tests pass and code quality is acceptable.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

            Update documentation for:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            1. Update any relevant documentation files
            2. Ensure CLAUDE.md reflects the changes if applicable
            3. Add/update code comments where needed
            4. Update README if user-facing changes were made

            Keep iterating until documentation is complete.
