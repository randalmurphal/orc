    title: Integrate Playwright MCP tools in task execution for UI testing
    description: 'When a task has requires_ui_testing: true, ensure Claude session has Playwright MCP tools available. During test phase: 1) Claude should run Playwright tests, 2) Capture screenshots for visual verification, 3) Auto-attach screenshots to task. Configure MCP server in Claude settings if not present. Add prompts that guide Claude to use visual testing for UI changes. Depends on TASK-020 (attachments) and TASK-021 (detection).'

            Implement the following feature/task:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            {{RETRY_CONTEXT}}

            1. Plan your implementation approach
            2. Implement the required changes
            3. Write/update tests alongside code
            4. Run tests and fix any failures

            Keep iterating until implementation is complete and tests pass.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

            Test and review the implementation:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Original task**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            1. Run the full test suite
            2. Review code for quality issues
            3. Check for edge cases and security issues
            4. Fix any problems found

            Keep iterating until all tests pass and code quality is acceptable.

            When done, output:
            <phase_complete>true</phase_complete>

            Update documentation for:

            **Task**: {{TASK_TITLE}}

            **Description**: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

            1. Update any relevant documentation files
            2. Ensure CLAUDE.md reflects the changes if applicable
            3. Add/update code comments where needed
            4. Update README if user-facing changes were made

            Keep iterating until documentation is complete.
