Evaluate whether the implementation satisfies ALL success criteria from the specification.

## Specification
{{.SpecContent}}

## Implementation Summary (Agent's Claimed Work)
{{.ImplementationSummary}}

## Task
For EACH success criterion in the spec (look for "Success Criteria" section, SC-1, SC-2, etc.):
1. Determine if it is MET, NOT_MET, or PARTIAL
2. Explain why in the reason field

Be strict: a criterion is only MET if there's clear evidence it's satisfied.
If the implementation summary doesn't mention addressing a criterion, mark it NOT_MET.

Set all_met=true ONLY if every single criterion has status=MET.
